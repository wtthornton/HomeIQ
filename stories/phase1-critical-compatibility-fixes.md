# Epic: Phase 1 - Critical Compatibility Fixes

**Status:** Complete (Stories 1–4, 11–12 executed; data-api blocker resolved; 45/47 services healthy; report: docs/planning/phase1-completion-report.md)
**Priority:** Critical
**Duration:** 1 week (5 days)
**Risk Level:** Medium
**Dependencies:** Phase 0 complete

## Overview

Update critical libraries across 30+ Python services and 2 Node.js frontend services to ensure compatibility, security, and stability. This phase focuses on high-risk library updates that affect core functionality.

## Objectives

1. **Standardize Core Libraries** - Ensure consistent versions across all services
2. **Update Critical Dependencies** - SQLAlchemy 2.0.46, aiosqlite 0.22.1, FastAPI 0.119.0+
3. **Zero-Downtime Deployment** - Sequential rebuild with health validation
4. **Maintain Service Availability** - 44/45 services must remain healthy
5. **Enable Phase 2** - Prepare for database and async library updates

## Success Criteria

- ✅ All rebuilt services show "healthy" status
- ✅ No errors in service logs (last 100 lines)
- ✅ API endpoints respond correctly (< 500ms)
- ✅ Frontend dashboards load successfully (< 3s)
- ✅ No service restarts in 1 hour post-deployment
- ✅ InfluxDB receiving data (verified via Jaeger traces)
- ✅ Performance regression < 10% from baseline

## Current State Analysis

### Requirements Base (requirements-base.txt)

**Current Versions:**
- SQLAlchemy: 2.0.45
