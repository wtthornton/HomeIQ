## 2024-12-19: Initial Product Planning

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead, Development Team

### Decision

HA Ingestor will be developed as a production-grade Python service that ingests all relevant Home Assistant activity in real-time and writes it to InfluxDB. The service will connect to both the existing Home Assistant Mosquitto broker (MQTT) and the Home Assistant WebSocket API to capture core event-bus activity that never hits MQTT.

### Context

Home Assistant administrators and DevOps teams need comprehensive visibility into system activity for monitoring, troubleshooting, and optimization. Current solutions are fragmented and lack production-grade features. The market opportunity exists for a unified, enterprise-ready ingestion service that can handle both MQTT and WebSocket data sources with optimized time-series storage.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **MQTT-only Solution**
   - Pros: Simpler implementation, lower complexity
   - Cons: Missing 20-40% of Home Assistant activity, limited visibility

2. **Generic Logging Solution**
   - Pros: Faster development, existing libraries
   - Cons: Not optimized for time-series data, poor performance at scale

3. **Home Assistant Add-on**
   - Pros: Native integration, easier deployment for HA users
   - Cons: Limited to HA ecosystem, harder to use in enterprise environments

4. **Multi-language Implementation**
   - Pros: Language flexibility, broader developer appeal
   - Cons: Increased complexity, harder to maintain, Python ecosystem is optimal for data processing

### Rationale

The decision to build a Python-based service with dual data source ingestion was driven by:
- **Completeness**: Capturing both MQTT and WebSocket ensures 100% activity visibility
- **Production Readiness**: Python ecosystem provides mature libraries for MQTT, WebSocket, and InfluxDB
- **Performance**: Optimized time-series storage with InfluxDB for efficient data handling
- **Enterprise Focus**: Production-grade features like monitoring, health checks, and containerization
- **Maintainability**: Single language codebase with comprehensive testing and documentation

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Complete visibility into Home Assistant activity
- Production-ready service with enterprise features
- Optimized performance for time-series data
- Comprehensive monitoring and observability
- Flexible deployment options (Docker, Kubernetes)

**Negative:**
- Higher initial development complexity
- Requires both MQTT and WebSocket expertise
- More complex testing requirements
- Larger dependency footprint
- Need for comprehensive error handling and recovery logic
