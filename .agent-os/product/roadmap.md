# Product Roadmap

## Phase 1: Core MVP Functionality âœ… COMPLETED

**Goal:** Establish the foundational ingestion pipeline with basic MQTT and WebSocket connectivity
**Success Criteria:** Successfully capture and store Home Assistant activity data from both sources

### Features

- [x] Project structure and configuration management `XS` âœ… (COMPLETED)
- [x] Environment-based configuration with validation `XS` âœ… (COMPLETED)
- [x] Basic logging and error handling `XS` âœ… (COMPLETED)

**Phase 1 Status:** All tasks completed. Project structure, configuration management, and logging systems are fully implemented and tested.

## Phase 2: Core Client Implementation âœ… COMPLETED

**Goal:** Implement MQTT and WebSocket clients with data models and InfluxDB integration
**Success Criteria:** Service can capture and store Home Assistant events from both data sources

### Features

- [x] MQTT client with connection handling and topic subscription `S` (2-3 days) âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] WebSocket client for Home Assistant event bus `S` (2-3 days) âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] Basic InfluxDB writer with simple point insertion `M` (1 week) âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] Data models and validation for MQTT and WebSocket events `S` (2-3 days) âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] Event processing pipeline and deduplication `M` (1 week) âœ… COMPLETED
