## Dependencies

- ✅ Phase 2 completion (Core Client Implementation)
- Docker environment for testing
- Prometheus instance for metrics testing
- Load testing tools for performance validation

## Testing Requirements

- Unit tests for all new components and enhancements
- Integration tests for health check endpoints and metrics
- End-to-end tests for complete monitoring workflow
- Performance tests for metrics collection and health checks
- Container deployment and operation tests
- Error handling and recovery scenario tests

## Documentation Requirements

- API documentation for health check endpoints
- Metrics documentation and dashboard setup
- Docker deployment and configuration guide
- Error handling and troubleshooting guide
- Production deployment checklist
- Monitoring and alerting setup guide

## Risk Mitigation

- **Metrics Overhead**: Use efficient collection strategies and sampling
- **Health Check Complexity**: Start simple and enhance incrementally
- **Container Performance**: Optimize image size and startup time
- **Error Recovery**: Implement gradual degradation and fallback strategies
