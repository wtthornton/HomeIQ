# Production Readiness Spec

**Created:** 2024-12-20
**Phase:** 3
**Effort:** ~2-3 weeks
**Status:** In Progress

## Overview

This spec covers the implementation of enterprise-grade features required for reliable production deployment of the Home Assistant Activity Ingestor service. After completing Phase 2 (Core Client Implementation), we now need to add production-ready features including monitoring, health checks, containerization, and comprehensive error handling.

## What's Being Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Structured Logging (`S` - 2-3 days) ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- Configurable log levels via environment variables
- Structured logging context for all operations
- Correlation IDs for request tracing
- Log rotation and retention policies

### 2. Health Check HTTP Endpoints (`S` - 2-3 days) ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- `/health` endpoint for basic service health
- `/ready` endpoint for readiness checks
- `/metrics` endpoint for Prometheus metrics
- Dependency health checks (MQTT, WebSocket, InfluxDB)

### 3. Prometheus Metrics Collection (`M` - 1 week)
- Metrics for event processing pipeline
- Metrics for client connections and operations
- Metrics for InfluxDB write operations
- Business metrics for Home Assistant events

### 4. Enhanced Connection Monitoring (`M` - 1 week)
- Connection health monitoring and quality metrics
- Improved reconnection with backoff strategies
- Connection pool management
- Performance metrics and monitoring

### 5. Optimized InfluxDB Batch Processing (`M` - 1 week)
- Configurable batch sizes and timeouts
- Batch compression and optimization
- Enhanced retry mechanisms
- Performance metrics and monitoring

### 6. Retry Logic and Circuit Breakers (`S` - 2-3 days)
- Retry policies for external service calls
- Circuit breaker pattern for failing services
- Configurable retry attempts and delays
- Metrics and monitoring

### 7. Docker Containerization (`S` - 2-3 days)
- Multi-stage Dockerfile for optimization
- Health check endpoint integration
- Environment-based configuration
- Graceful shutdown handling

### 8. Comprehensive Error Handling (`M` - 1 week)
- Error categorization and classification
- Automatic error recovery strategies
- Error reporting and alerting
- Data consistency guarantees

## Dependencies

- ‚úÖ Phase 2 completion (Core Client Implementation)
- Docker environment for testing
- Prometheus instance for metrics testing
- Load testing tools for performance validation

## Success Criteria

- Service can be deployed in production with confidence
- All critical operations are monitored and alertable
- Service handles failures gracefully with automatic recovery
- Container health checks work with orchestration systems
- Comprehensive metrics provide operational visibility
- Error handling prevents data loss and maintains consistency

## Current Progress

### ‚úÖ Completed
- **Enhanced Structured Logging**: Configurable levels, structured context, correlation IDs, log rotation
- **Health Check Endpoints**: FastAPI server with `/health`, `/ready`, `/metrics`, and dependency checks
- **Prometheus Metrics Collection**: Complete metrics system with registry, collector, and Prometheus export
- **Enhanced Connection Monitoring**: Connection health tracking, performance metrics, pool management, and monitoring

### üîÑ In Progress
- **Final Testing and Integration**: Completing comprehensive testing and preparing for production deployment

### ‚è≥ Pending
- Final integration testing
- Performance validation
- Production deployment preparation

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Enhanced logging system completed
2. ‚úÖ Health check endpoints completed
3. ‚úÖ Prometheus metrics collection completed
4. ‚úÖ Enhanced connection monitoring completed
5. ‚úÖ InfluxDB batch processing optimization completed
6. ‚úÖ Retry logic and circuit breakers completed
7. ‚úÖ Docker containerization completed
8. ‚úÖ Comprehensive error handling completed
9. üîÑ Complete final testing and integration
10. Prepare for production deployment
