# Production Readiness Spec

**Created:** 2024-12-20  
**Phase:** 3  
**Effort:** ~2-3 weeks  
**Status:** Planning

## Overview

This spec covers the implementation of enterprise-grade features required for reliable production deployment of the Home Assistant Activity Ingestor service. After completing Phase 2 (Core Client Implementation), we now need to add production-ready features including monitoring, health checks, containerization, and comprehensive error handling.

## User Stories

### 1. Production Monitoring
**As a** DevOps engineer  
**I want** comprehensive monitoring and alerting for the service  
**So that** I can ensure the service is running reliably and respond to issues quickly

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Service exposes Prometheus metrics for all key operations
- Health check endpoints return service status
- Structured logging with configurable levels
- Performance metrics for event processing pipeline

### 2. Containerized Deployment
**As a** system administrator  
**I want** the service packaged as a Docker container with health checks  
**So that** I can deploy it consistently across different environments

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Dockerfile with multi-stage build
- Health check endpoint for container orchestration
- Environment-based configuration
- Graceful shutdown handling

### 3. Enterprise Error Handling
**As a** operations team member  
**I want** comprehensive error handling and recovery mechanisms  
**So that** the service can handle failures gracefully and maintain data integrity

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Retry logic with exponential backoff for all external services
- Circuit breaker pattern for failing dependencies
- Comprehensive error logging and categorization
- Automatic recovery from common failure scenarios

## Spec Scope

### In Scope

1. **Structured Logging with Configurable Levels** (`S`)
   - Implement configurable log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)
   - Add structured logging context for all operations

2. **Health Check HTTP Endpoints** (`S`)
   - Create `/health` endpoint for basic service health
   - Create `/ready` endpoint for readiness checks
   - Create `/metrics` endpoint for Prometheus metrics
   - Implement dependency health checks (MQTT, WebSocket, InfluxDB)

3. **Prometheus Metrics Collection** (`M`)
   - Add metrics for event processing pipeline
   - Add metrics for client connections and operations
   - Add metrics for InfluxDB write operations
   - Add custom business metrics for Home Assistant events

4. **Connection Monitoring and Automatic Reconnection** (`M`)
   - Enhanced connection health monitoring
   - Connection quality metrics (latency, throughput)
   - Automatic reconnection with backoff strategies
   - Connection pool management

5. **Batch Processing for InfluxDB Writes** (`M`)
   - Configurable batch sizes and timeouts
   - Batch compression and optimization
   - Failed batch retry mechanisms
   - Batch performance metrics

6. **Retry Logic with Exponential Backoff** (`S`)
   - Implement retry policies for all external service calls
   - Configurable retry attempts and delays
   - Circuit breaker pattern for failing services
   - Retry metrics and monitoring

7. **Docker Containerization with Health Checks** (`S`)
   - Multi-stage Dockerfile for optimized image size
   - Health check endpoint integration
   - Environment variable configuration
   - Graceful shutdown handling

8. **Comprehensive Error Handling and Recovery** (`M`)

   - Data consistency guarantees

### Out of Scope

- Kubernetes deployment manifests (Phase 5)
- Advanced security features (Phase 5)
- Performance optimization (Phase 4)
- Multi-tenant support (Phase 5)

## Expected Deliverables

1. **Enhanced Logging System**
   - Configurable logging configuration
   - Structured log format with context
   - Log rotation and retention policies

2. **Health Check System**
   - HTTP endpoints for health monitoring
   - Dependency health checks
   - Service readiness indicators

3. **Metrics and Monitoring**
   - Prometheus metrics endpoint
   - Custom business metrics
   - Performance monitoring dashboards

4. **Containerization**
   - Production-ready Dockerfile
   - Health check integration
   - Environment configuration

5. **Error Handling and Recovery**
   - Retry mechanisms with backoff
   - Circuit breaker implementation
   - Error categorization and reporting

## Success Criteria

- Service can be deployed in production with confidence
- All critical operations are monitored and alertable
- Service handles failures gracefully with automatic recovery
- Container health checks work with orchestration systems
- Comprehensive metrics provide operational visibility
- Error handling prevents data loss and maintains consistency

## Dependencies

- âœ… Phase 2 completion (Core Client Implementation)
- Docker environment for testing
- Prometheus instance for metrics testing
- Load testing tools for performance validation

## Technical Approach

### Logging Enhancement
- Extend existing `structlog` implementation
- Add log level configuration via environment variables
- Implement structured context for all operations
- Add correlation ID generation and propagation

### Health Check Implementation
- Create FastAPI-based HTTP server for health endpoints
- Implement dependency health checks
- Add service readiness validation
- Integrate with container health checks

### Metrics Collection
- Use Prometheus client library for Python
- Define custom metrics for business operations
- Implement metrics collection for all components
- Add performance timing metrics

### Containerization
- Multi-stage Dockerfile for optimization
- Health check endpoint integration
- Environment-based configuration
- Graceful shutdown handling

### Error Handling
- Implement retry policies with exponential backoff
- Add circuit breaker pattern for external services
- Enhance error logging and categorization
- Implement automatic recovery strategies

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Test all new components and enhancements
   - Mock external dependencies for isolation
   - Test error handling and recovery logic

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Test health check endpoints
   - Test metrics collection and exposure
   - Test container health check integration

3. **End-to-End Tests**
   - Test complete monitoring workflow
   - Test error recovery scenarios
   - Test container deployment and operation

4. **Performance Tests**
   - Test metrics collection overhead
   - Test health check response times
   - Test error handling performance impact

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Metrics Collection Overhead**: Adding comprehensive metrics could impact performance
  - *Mitigation*: Use efficient metrics collection and sampling strategies

### Medium Risk
- **Health Check Complexity**: Complex dependency health checks could be unreliable
  - *Mitigation*: Start with simple checks and enhance incrementally

### Low Risk
- **Containerization**: Standard Docker practices with minimal customization
- **Logging Enhancement**: Building on existing proven logging infrastructure

## Timeline

**Week 1**: Logging enhancement and health check endpoints
**Week 2**: Metrics collection and monitoring
**Week 3**: Containerization and error handling
**Week 4**: Testing, integration, and documentation

## Next Steps

1. Review and approve this spec
2. Set up development environment with Docker and Prometheus
3. Begin implementation with logging enhancement
4. Follow incremental development approach
5. Complete comprehensive testing
6. Prepare for production deployment
