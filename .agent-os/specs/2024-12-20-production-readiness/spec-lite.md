# Production Readiness Spec - Lite

**Created:** 2024-12-20  
**Phase:** 3  
**Effort:** ~2-3 weeks  
**Status:** Planning

## Goal

Add enterprise-grade features for reliable production deployment including monitoring, health checks, containerization, and comprehensive error handling.

## Scope

- **Structured Logging**: Configurable levels, structured context, correlation IDs
- **Health Checks**: HTTP endpoints for health, readiness, and metrics
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus metrics collection for all operations
- **Containerization**: Docker with health checks and graceful shutdown
- **Error Handling**: Retry logic, circuit breakers, automatic recovery

## Success Criteria

- Service can be deployed in production with confidence
- All critical operations are monitored and alertable
- Service handles failures gracefully with automatic recovery
- Container health checks work with orchestration systems

## Dependencies

- âœ… Phase 2 completion (Core Client Implementation)
- Docker environment for testing
- Prometheus instance for metrics testing

## Next Steps

1. Review and approve this spec
2. Set up development environment
3. Begin implementation with logging enhancement
4. Complete comprehensive testing
5. Prepare for production deployment
