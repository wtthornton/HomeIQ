# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Core Client Implementation: MQTT, WebSocket, and Data Ingestion
> Created: 2024-12-20

## Overview

Implement the core data ingestion functionality for the Home Assistant Activity Ingestor service. This includes MQTT client for subscribing to Home Assistant state changes, WebSocket client for real-time event streaming, data models for event validation, and basic InfluxDB integration for time-series data storage.

## User Stories

### MQTT Integration Story

As a **Home Assistant user**, I want the service to capture all MQTT state changes and sensor updates, so that I can analyze historical data patterns and system behavior over time.

**Workflow:** Service connects to Home Assistant MQTT broker, subscribes to relevant topics (e.g., `homeassistant/+/+/state`, `homeassistant/sensor/+/state`), receives messages, validates them, and stores them in InfluxDB with proper timestamps and metadata.

### WebSocket Event Streaming Story

As a **Home Assistant user**, I want the service to capture real-time events from the Home Assistant event bus, so that I can monitor system activity, automation triggers, and user interactions as they happen.

**Workflow:** Service connects to Home Assistant WebSocket API, subscribes to event types (state_changed, automation_triggered, service_called), receives events, validates them, and stores them in InfluxDB with proper event categorization and metadata.

### Data Storage Story

As a **data analyst**, I want all captured events to be stored in InfluxDB with consistent schema and metadata, so that I can query and analyze Home Assistant activity patterns, system performance, and user behavior over time.

**Workflow:** Service receives events from MQTT and WebSocket, transforms them into standardized data models, validates the data, and writes points to InfluxDB with proper tags, fields, and timestamps for efficient querying.

## Spec Scope

1. **MQTT Client Implementation** - Full MQTT client with connection handling, topic subscription, message processing, and automatic reconnection
2. **WebSocket Client Implementation** - WebSocket client for Home Assistant API with event subscription, heartbeat management, and connection recovery
3. **Data Models** - Pydantic models for MQTT messages, WebSocket events, and InfluxDB data points with comprehensive validation
4. **InfluxDB Integration** - Basic writer with point insertion, batch processing, and error handling
5. **Event Processing Pipeline** - Unified pipeline for processing events from both sources with deduplication and validation
6. **Error Handling and Recovery** - Comprehensive error handling, automatic reconnection, and graceful degradation

## Out of Scope

- Advanced filtering and transformation (Phase 3)
- Performance optimization and batching (Phase 3)
- Health check endpoints (Phase 2 - separate spec)
- Prometheus metrics (Phase 2 - separate spec)
- Docker containerization (Phase 2 - separate spec)
- Multi-tenant support (Phase 4)
- Advanced analytics (Phase 4)

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Functional MQTT client** that connects to Home Assistant MQTT broker, subscribes to relevant topics, and processes messages
2. **Functional WebSocket client** that connects to Home Assistant API, subscribes to events, and processes real-time updates
3. **Comprehensive data models** for all event types with validation and transformation
4. **Basic InfluxDB writer** that can store events with proper schema and metadata
5. **Unified event processing pipeline** that handles both data sources consistently
6. **Robust error handling** with automatic reconnection and graceful failure modes
7. **Complete test coverage** for all client functionality and data processing

## Success Criteria

- Service can successfully connect to both MQTT broker and WebSocket API
- Service captures and stores MQTT state changes and sensor updates
- Service captures and stores WebSocket events from Home Assistant
- All data is properly validated and stored in InfluxDB with consistent schema
- Service handles connection failures gracefully with automatic recovery
- Service can process events from both sources simultaneously without conflicts
- All functionality is thoroughly tested with high coverage
- Service can run continuously without memory leaks or connection issues
