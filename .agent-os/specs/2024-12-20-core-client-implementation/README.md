# Core Client Implementation Spec

**Created:** 2024-12-20  
**Phase:** 2  
**Effort:** ~2-3 weeks  
**Status:** In Progress

## Overview

This spec covers the implementation of the core data ingestion functionality for the Home Assistant Activity Ingestor service. After completing Phase 1 (Project Structure and Configuration), we now need to implement the actual clients that will capture data from Home Assistant.

## What's Being Implemented

### 1. MQTT Client (`S` - 2-3 days) âœ… COMPLETED
- Connect to Home Assistant MQTT broker
- Subscribe to state change topics
- Process and validate MQTT messages
- Handle connection failures and reconnection

### 2. WebSocket Client (`S` - 2-3 days) âœ… COMPLETED
- Connect to Home Assistant WebSocket API
- Subscribe to real-time events
- Manage heartbeat and connection health
- Handle authentication and event processing

### 3. Data Models (`S` - 2-3 days) âœ… COMPLETED
- Pydantic models for MQTT and WebSocket events
- Data validation and transformation
- InfluxDB point schema design
- Event deduplication logic

### 4. InfluxDB Integration (`M` - 1 week) âœ… COMPLETED
- Connect to InfluxDB with authentication
- Write data points with proper schema
- Basic batch processing
- Error handling and retry logic

### 5. Event Processing Pipeline (`M` - 1 week) âœ… COMPLETED
- Unified event handling from both sources
- Event transformation and validation
- Routing to storage handlers
- Performance optimization

### 6. Component Integration (`S` - 2-3 days) âœ… COMPLETED
- Update main.py to use all components
- End-to-end testing
- Graceful shutdown and cleanup
- Configuration validation

## Dependencies

- âœ… Phase 1 completion (Project Structure and Configuration)
- Home Assistant instance with MQTT broker enabled
- Home Assistant instance with WebSocket API accessible
- InfluxDB instance for data storage testing

## Success Criteria

- Service can successfully connect to both MQTT broker and WebSocket API
- Service captures and stores MQTT state changes and sensor updates
- Service captures and stores WebSocket events from Home Assistant
- All data is properly validated and stored in InfluxDB with consistent schema
- Service handles connection failures gracefully with automatic recovery
- Service can process events from both sources simultaneously without conflicts

## Current Progress

### âœ… Completed
- **MQTT Client**: Full implementation with connection management, topic subscription, message processing, and automatic reconnection
- **WebSocket Client**: Full implementation with authentication, event subscription, heartbeat management, and automatic reconnection
- **Data Models**: Complete implementation of MQTT events, WebSocket events, and InfluxDB points with validation and transformation
- **InfluxDB Integration**: Full implementation with connection management, batch processing, error handling, and retry logic
- **Event Processing Pipeline**: Complete implementation with unified event handling, deduplication, transformation, and routing
- **Component Integration**: Full end-to-end integration with graceful shutdown, error handling, and monitoring
- **Complete Data Flow**: Events from both MQTT and WebSocket sources are processed through the pipeline and stored in InfluxDB

## Next Steps

1. âœ… MQTT client implementation completed
2. âœ… WebSocket client implementation completed
3. âœ… Data models implementation completed
4. âœ… InfluxDB integration completed
5. âœ… Event processing pipeline completed
6. âœ… Component integration completed

## ðŸŽ‰ Phase 2 Complete!

**Phase 2: Core Client Implementation** has been successfully completed! The service now provides:

- **Complete Data Ingestion**: Captures events from both MQTT and WebSocket sources
- **Data Processing**: Validates, transforms, and deduplicates events
- **Data Storage**: Stores processed events in InfluxDB with proper schema
- **Production Ready**: Includes error handling, reconnection logic, and monitoring
- **End-to-End Integration**: All components work together seamlessly

The next phase will focus on **Production Readiness** with enterprise-grade features like monitoring, health checks, and deployment optimizations.

**Next Phase:** [Phase 3: Production Readiness](../2024-12-20-production-readiness/)
