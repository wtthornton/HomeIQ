## Installation Complete! ✅

All tools are now installed and ready to use.

## Run Analysis Now

### Option 1: Quick Check (Recommended for first run)
```powershell
# Check Python complexity
python -m radon cc services/data-api/src/ -a -s

# Check Python maintainability
python -m radon mi services/data-api/src/ -s

# Check TypeScript linting
cd services/health-dashboard
npm run lint
```

### Option 2: Full Analysis (Comprehensive)
```powershell
# Run the full analysis script (when created)
.\scripts\analyze-code-quality.ps1
```

### Option 3: Frontend Only
```powershell
cd services/health-dashboard
npm run analyze:all
```
