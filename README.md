## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important: Docker Configuration**

**Before making ANY changes to Dockerfiles or nginx configs, read:**
- üìò **[Docker Structure Guide](docs/DOCKER_STRUCTURE_GUIDE.md)** - Complete guide to Docker structure (DO NOT BREAK THIS!)
- üöÄ **[Quick Reference](docs/QUICK_REFERENCE_DOCKER.md)** - Quick reference for common tasks

**Critical files that must not be broken:**
- `services/websocket-ingestion/Dockerfile` - Uses `python -m src.main`
- `services/admin-api/Dockerfile` - Requires `ENV PYTHONPATH=/app:/app/src`
- `services/health-dashboard/nginx.conf` - API proxy configuration

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Home Assistant instance with long-lived access token
- OpenWeatherMap API key (optional, for weather data)

### Setup

#### üöÄ Quick Start with Deployment Wizard (Recommended)

The easiest way to get started:

```bash

cd ha-ingestor

# 2. Run the deployment wizard
./scripts/deploy-wizard.sh

# 3. Start services
docker-compose up -d

# 4. Access dashboard
open http://localhost:3000
```

The deployment wizard will:

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Services not starting:**
   - Check environment variables in `.env`
   - Verify Docker is running
   - Check logs: `./scripts/view-logs.sh`

2. **Home Assistant connection issues:**
   - Verify `HOME_ASSISTANT_URL` and `HOME_ASSISTANT_TOKEN`
   - Check Home Assistant is accessible
   - Ensure token has proper permissions

3. **WebSocket connection issues:**
   - Check WebSocket service logs: `docker-compose logs websocket-ingestion`
   - Verify authentication timing (1-second delay added for stability)
   - Check subscription status in health endpoint
   - See [WebSocket Troubleshooting Guide](docs/WEBSOCKET_TROUBLESHOOTING.md)

4. **Dashboard 502 errors:**
   - Check nginx proxy configuration in `services/health-dashboard/nginx.conf`
   - Verify admin-api service is running: `docker-compose ps admin-api`
   - Test API endpoints directly: `curl http://localhost:8003/api/v1/health`

5. **InfluxDB connection issues:**
   - Check InfluxDB credentials
   - Verify network connectivity
   - Check InfluxDB logs

### Cleanup

Clean up all Docker resources:
