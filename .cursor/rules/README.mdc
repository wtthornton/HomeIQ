- **documentation-standards.mdc** - Documentation standards and formatting guidelines
- **security-best-practices.mdc** - Security best practices and guidelines

## How to Use

### Activating BMAD Agents
Use `@agent-name` to activate specific BMAD agents:
```
@bmad-master    # Universal task executor
@architect      # System architecture and design
@dev           # Full-stack development
@pm            # Product management
@qa            # Quality assurance
@po            # Product ownership
@sm            # Scrum master
@ux-expert     # User experience design
@analyst       # Business analysis
```

### Agent Commands
All BMAD agents use `*` prefix for commands:
- `*help` - Show available commands
- `*exit` - Exit agent persona
- `*yolo` - Toggle Yolo mode (skip confirmations)

### Context7 KB Integration Commands (BMad Master)
- `*context7-resolve {library}` - Resolve library name to Context7-compatible library ID
- `*context7-docs {library} {topic}` - Get focused documentation (KB-first, then Context7)
- `*context7-help` - Show Context7 usage examples and best practices
- `*context7-kb-status` - Show knowledge base statistics and hit rates
- `*context7-kb-search {query}` - Search local knowledge base
- `*context7-kb-cleanup` - Clean up old/unused cached documentation
- `*context7-kb-rebuild` - Rebuild knowledge base index
- `*context7-kb-analytics` - Show detailed KB usage analytics
- `*context7-kb-test` - Test KB integration and cache functionality

### File References
When referencing files in rules, use the format:
- `[filename](mdc:path/to/file)` for relative paths
- Always reference from workspace root

## Rule Types

### Always Apply Rules
Rules with `alwaysApply: true` are automatically applied to every request:
- **project-structure.mdc** - Project structure guidance
- **README.mdc** - This overview

### File-Specific Rules
Rules with `globs` apply only to matching file types:
- **code-quality.mdc** - Applies to code files (*.py, *.js, *.ts, etc.)
- **development-environment.mdc** - Applies to config files
- **documentation-standards.mdc** - Applies to documentation files
- **security-best-practices.mdc** - Applies to code and config files

### Manual Rules
Rules with `description` can be manually invoked:
- **bmad-workflow.mdc** - BMAD workflow integration

## Best Practices

1. **Use Appropriate Agents**: Choose the right BMAD agent for your task
2. **Follow Standards**: Adhere to code quality and documentation standards
3. **Security First**: Always consider security implications
4. **Document Everything**: Keep documentation up-to-date
5. **Test Thoroughly**: Write tests for all new functionality
6. **Leverage Context7 KB**: Use Context7 KB cache for up-to-date library documentation with intelligent caching
