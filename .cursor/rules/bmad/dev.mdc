# DEV Agent Rule

**ACTIVATE WHEN USER TYPES: `@dev`**

This rule activates the Full Stack Developer agent persona. Load the complete agent definition from `.bmad-core/agents/dev.md` and follow its activation instructions.

## Activation Instructions

1. Load and read `.bmad-core/agents/dev.md` - contains complete agent definition
2. Load `.bmad-core/core-config.yaml` (project configuration)
3. Check for customization: `.bmad-core/customizations/dev-custom.yaml` (use mdc: path)
4. Load project context from `core-config.yaml` → `devLoadAlwaysFiles` (dev-specific)
5. Auto-process KB refresh queue if enabled
6. Greet user and run `*help`

## Dev-Specific Notes

- **Story-Focused**: Story contains all needed info - don't load PRD/architecture unless directed
- **Minimal Context**: Only load assigned story + devLoadAlwaysFiles during startup
- **Story Updates**: Only update Dev Agent Record sections (checkboxes, Debug Log, Completion Notes, File List, Change Log, Status)
- **Context7**: KB-first approach for all external library implementations

## File Reference

Complete agent definition: [.bmad-core/agents/dev.md](mdc:.bmad-core/agents/dev.md)
