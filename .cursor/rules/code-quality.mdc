# Code Quality Standards

## General Principles

- **Clarity over Cleverness**: Write code that is easy to understand and maintain
- **Consistency**: Follow established patterns and conventions
- **Documentation**: Document complex logic and architectural decisions
- **Testing**: Write tests for all new functionality

## Python Standards

- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use type hints for function parameters and return values (PEP 484)
- Write docstrings for all public functions and classes (Google or NumPy style)
- Use meaningful variable and function names (snake_case for functions/variables)
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Use dataclasses or Pydantic models for data structures
- Handle exceptions explicitly, avoid bare except clauses
- Use context managers (with statements) for resource management
- Follow single responsibility principle

## JavaScript/TypeScript Standards

- Use TypeScript for all new code (strict mode enabled)
- Follow ESLint and Prettier configurations
- Use meaningful variable and function names (camelCase for functions/variables)
- Prefer functional programming patterns where appropriate
- Write JSDoc comments for complex functions
- Use const by default, let when reassignment needed, avoid var
- Prefer arrow functions for callbacks and short functions
- Use async/await over raw promises for better readability
- Implement proper error boundaries in React components
- Use TypeScript interfaces for object shapes, types for unions/primitives

## Documentation Standards

- Use clear, concise language
- Include examples for complex concepts
- Keep documentation up-to-date with code changes
- Use consistent formatting and structure

## YAML Standards

- Use consistent indentation (2 spaces)
- Include comments for complex configurations
- Validate YAML syntax before committing
- Use meaningful key names

## File Organization

- Group related functionality together
- Use clear directory structure
- Avoid deep nesting (max 3-4 levels)
- Use descriptive file names

## Testing Requirements

- Write unit tests for all new functions
- Include integration tests for API endpoints
- Test error conditions and edge cases
- Maintain test coverage above 80%
- Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested
- Follow AAA pattern: Arrange, Act, Assert
- Mock external dependencies in unit tests
- Use test fixtures for common test data
- Test both happy path and error scenarios
- Include performance tests for critical paths

## Code Review Checklist

- [ ] Code follows style guidelines
- [ ] Tests are included and passing
- [ ] Documentation is updated
- [ ] No hardcoded values or secrets
- [ ] Error handling is appropriate
- [ ] Performance considerations addressed
- [ ] Type hints/types are complete and accurate
- [ ] Logging is appropriate and follows standards
- [ ] Security best practices are followed
- [ ] Code is readable and maintainable
- [ ] No commented-out code or debug statements
- [ ] Dependencies are justified and documented

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Use TappsCodingAgents for Quality Assurance

**AI assistants MUST use TappsCodingAgents and Simple Mode for all code quality checks, testing, and code creation.**

### Required Workflow

**Before creating or modifying code:**
1. ✅ Use `@simple-mode *build` for new features (orchestrates: enhancer → planner → architect → designer → implementer → reviewer → tester)
2. ✅ Use `@simple-mode *review {file}` for code quality checks (orchestrates: reviewer → improver)
3. ✅ Use `@simple-mode *test {file}` for test generation (orchestrates: tester)
4. ✅ Use `@simple-mode *fix {file} {description}` for bug fixes (orchestrates: debugger → implementer → tester)

**After creating or modifying code:**
1. ✅ **ALWAYS** run code review: `python -m tapps_agents.cli reviewer review {file}` or `@simple-mode *review {file}`
2. ✅ **ALWAYS** check quality score: `python -m tapps_agents.cli reviewer score {file}` (minimum 70/100, 80+ for critical services)
3. ✅ **ALWAYS** generate tests: `python -m tapps_agents.cli tester test {file}` or `@simple-mode *test {file}`
4. ✅ **ALWAYS** verify test coverage meets threshold (80% minimum)

### Quality Gates

**Code MUST pass these quality gates before being considered complete:**
- ✅ Overall quality score ≥ 70 (80+ for critical services like websocket-ingestion, data-api)
- ✅ Security score ≥ 7.0/10
- ✅ Maintainability score ≥ 7.0/10
- ✅ Test coverage ≥ 80%
- ✅ No critical security vulnerabilities
- ✅ All linting and type checking passes

### Quick Commands

```bash
# Quick quality check (fast, no LLM)
python -m tapps_agents.cli reviewer score {file}

# Full code review with detailed feedback
python -m tapps_agents.cli reviewer review {file}

# Generate comprehensive tests
python -m tapps_agents.cli tester test {file}

# Generate quality reports
python -m tapps_agents.cli reviewer report . json markdown html
```

### Why This Matters

TappsCodingAgents provides:
- **Objective quality metrics** (5-metric scoring system)
- **Expert consultation** (security, performance, testing experts)
- **Automated test generation** with coverage analysis
- **Comprehensive code review** with actionable feedback
- **Workflow orchestration** ensuring proper SDLC stages

**DO NOT skip these steps.** They are essential for maintaining code quality in a 30+ microservice architecture.
