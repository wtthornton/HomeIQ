# BMAD Workflow Integration

This rule helps integrate BMAD methodology into development workflows.

## Workflow Phases

### 1. Planning Phase (Web Agents Recommended)
- Use `@analyst` for market research and competitor analysis
- Use `@pm` for PRD creation and product strategy
- Use `@ux-expert` for frontend specifications
- Use `@architect` for system architecture design
- Use `@qa` for early test strategy and risk assessment

### 2. Development Phase (IDE Agents)
- Use `@po` for story management and prioritization
- Use `@sm` for process management and sprint planning
- Use `@dev` for implementation and coding
- Use `@qa` for quality gates and testing

## Document Management

### PRD Management
- Main PRD: [docs/prd.md](mdc:docs/prd.md)
- Sharded PRD: [docs/prd/](mdc:docs/prd/)
- Use `*shard-prd` command to break down large PRDs

### Architecture Management
- Main Architecture: [docs/architecture.md](mdc:docs/architecture.md)
- Sharded Architecture: [docs/architecture/](mdc:docs/architecture/)
- Use `*shard-doc` command to break down large documents

### Story Management
- Stories Location: [docs/stories/](mdc:docs/stories/)
- Follow naming convention: `story-{epic}-{number}-{slug}.md`
- Use `*create-story` for new stories
- Use `*validate-story` for story validation

## Quality Gates

### QA Process
- QA Results: [docs/qa/](mdc:docs/qa/)
- Gate Files: `{epic}.{story}-{slug}.yml`
- Use `*review` command for comprehensive story review
- Use `*gate` command for quality gate decisions

### Checklist Usage
- Use `*execute-checklist` for process validation
- Available checklists in [.bmad-core/checklists/](mdc:.bmad-core/checklists/)
- Story DoD: [story-dod-checklist.md](mdc:.bmad-core/checklists/story-dod-checklist.md)

## Agent Commands

All BMAD agents use `*` prefix for commands:
- `*help` - Show available commands
- `*exit` - Exit agent persona
- `*yolo` - Toggle Yolo mode (skip confirmations)

## File References

When referencing BMAD files, use the format:
- `[filename](mdc:path/to/file)` for relative paths
- Always reference from workspace root

## Process Integration

1. **Story Creation**: Use `@po` or `@pm` to create stories
2. **Architecture Review**: Use `@architect` for design decisions
3. **Development**: Use `@dev` for implementation
4. **Quality Assurance**: Use `@qa` for testing and review
5. **Documentation**: Use `@bmad-master` for document management
