# Context7 Auto-Invoke Rule

Always use Context7 when you need code generation, setup or configuration steps, or
library/API documentation. This means you should automatically run
`resolve-library-id` followed by `get-library-docs` without waiting for the user to
explicitly ask.

## When to Use Context7

- **Library Documentation**: Looking up API references, usage patterns
- **Code Generation**: Need accurate library-specific code
- **Configuration**: Setting up frameworks, tools, or libraries
- **Best Practices**: Understanding recommended patterns for a library

## Commands

```
# Resolve library ID first
mcp_Context7_resolve-library-id

# Then query documentation
mcp_Context7_query-docs
```
