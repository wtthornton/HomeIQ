## Usage in Cursor AI

When working in Cursor AI, you can:

1. **Run workflows directly:**
   - Type: "Run rapid development workflow"
   - Or: "Execute full SDLC pipeline"
   - Or: "Start quality improvement"

2. **Use voice commands:**
   - "run rapid dev"
   - "execute enterprise workflow"
   - "start quick fix"

3. **Reference in conversations:**
   - "Use the rapid workflow for this feature"
   - "This needs the full enterprise workflow"
   - "Run the quality improvement cycle"

## When to Use Each Workflow

- **Complete enterprise software development lifecycle with all quality gates, compliance checks, and comprehensive documentation** → `workflow enterprise-development`
- **Debug and fix issues in existing code** → `workflow simple-fix-issues`
- **Improve code quality through review and refactoring** → `workflow simple-improve-quality`
- **Build new features with automatic quality checks** → `workflow simple-new-feature`

## Integration

These workflows integrate with:
- ✅ Expert consultation (domain experts)
- ✅ Quality gates (scoring thresholds)
- ✅ Context tiers (token optimization)
- ✅ Multi-agent orchestration
- ✅ Git worktree isolation

## List All Presets

```bash
python -m tapps_agents.cli workflow list
```

## Customization

Workflow presets are defined in `workflows/presets/`:
- `enterprise-development.yaml`
- `simple-fix-issues.yaml`
- `simple-improve-quality.yaml`
- `simple-new-feature.yaml`

You can modify these files or create your own presets.
