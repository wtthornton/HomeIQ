# Code Review Integration Summary

## What Was Created

I've analyzed your `.bmad-core` workflow and created a comprehensive code review integration system for long agent builds.

### üìÅ New Files Created

1. **`.bmad-core/tasks/progressive-code-review.md`**
   - Task-level code review after each task completion
   - Catches issues early when context is fresh
   - **RECOMMENDED STARTING POINT**

2. **`.bmad-core/tasks/background-code-review.md`**
   - Continuous background review during development
   - For very long builds (8+ hours)
   - Optional advanced feature

3. **`.bmad-core/data/code-review-integration-guide.md`**
   - Comprehensive decision guide
   - ROI analysis
   - Implementation roadmap
   - Performance-specific checks for HomeIQ

4. **`.bmad-core/data/code-review-config-template.yaml`**
   - Ready-to-use configuration
   - Multiple scenario templates
   - Copy-paste into `core-config.yaml`

5. **`.bmad-core/utils/progressive-review-implementation-example.md`**
   - Concrete before/after example
   - Technical implementation details
   - Real HomeIQ story example

## The Problem You Identified

Your pre-commit hook idea addresses a real issue:
- **Current BMAD flow**: Dev completes entire story ‚Üí QA reviews ‚Üí Issues found ‚Üí Dev fixes
- **Problem**: By final QA, context is lost, fixes are expensive, refactoring may be needed
- **Your hook**: Reviews before commit, but only catches issues at commit time (may be hours into work)

## The Better Solution

**Progressive Task-Level Reviews** - Review after EACH task, not just at story end.

### Why This is Better Than Your Pre-Commit Hook

| Aspect | Your Pre-Commit Hook | Progressive Review |
|--------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **Timing** | On git commit | After each task |
| **Frequency** | Once per commit | 5-10x per story |
| **Feedback loop** | Hours delayed | Immediate |
| **Context** | May be lost | Always fresh |
| **Fix cost** | 30 min/issue | 5 min/issue |
| **Integration** | External to BMAD | Native BMAD workflow |
| **Blocking behavior** | Binary (all or nothing) | Smart (only HIGH blocks) |

### Recommendation: Use BOTH

```
Progressive reviews (primary)
  ‚Üì
Pre-commit hook (safety net)
  ‚Üì
Final QA review (comprehensive)
```

## Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Add Configuration

Edit `.bmad-core/core-config.yaml` and add:

```yaml
qa:
  qaLocation: docs/qa  # existing

  # NEW: Add this
  progressive_review:
    enabled: true
    review_location: docs/qa/progressive
    auto_trigger: true
    severity_blocks: [high]

    ai_config:
      model: "claude-sonnet-4-5"
      max_tokens: 4000
      temperature: 0.0

    review_focus:
      - security
      - performance  # Uses CLAUDE.md
      - testing
      - standards
```

### Step 2: Update Dev Agent (Optional)

The `progressive-code-review.md` task is already callable by the dev agent. You can:

**Option A (Manual):** Dev agent runs `*review-task` after each task
**Option B (Automatic):** Modify `dev.md` to auto-trigger (see implementation example)

### Step 3: Test on One Story

Pick a medium-complexity story (5-7 tasks) and run with progressive reviews:

```
1. Dev agent implements Task 1
2. Run: "Review this task using progressive-code-review"
3. See findings
4. Fix if HIGH severity
5. Mark task complete
6. Repeat for each task
```

### Step 4: Measure Results

After the story, track:
- Issues found: ___
- Issues fixed immediately: ___
- Time saved vs finding in final QA: ___
- Developer experience: Good / Neutral / Bad

## What Makes This Special for HomeIQ

Your `CLAUDE.md` contains comprehensive performance guidelines. The reviews specifically check for:

### Performance Anti-Patterns Caught

1. **Async violations** ‚Üí `CLAUDE.md#api-performance`
   - Blocking operations in async functions
   - Synchronous HTTP calls (requests vs aiohttp)

2. **Database inefficiency** ‚Üí `CLAUDE.md#database-performance`
   - N+1 queries
   - Unbatched writes
   - Unbounded queries (no LIMIT)
   - Missing indexes

3. **Caching missing** ‚Üí `CLAUDE.md#caching-strategies`
   - Expensive operations without caching
   - Inappropriate TTLs

4. **Event processing** ‚Üí `CLAUDE.md#event-processing-performance`
   - Individual writes instead of batching
   - Memory leaks in long-running processes

### Example Review Output

```yaml
findings:
  - id: "TASK-2-PERF-001"
    severity: high
    category: performance
    file: "services/auth-api/src/login.py"
    line: 67
    finding: "Synchronous database query in async endpoint"
    impact: "Blocks event loop, violates CLAUDE.md target of <100ms response"
    suggested_fix: "Use await session.execute() instead of session.query()"
    references:
      - "CLAUDE.md#api-performance (Async Everything)"
      - "CLAUDE.md#performance-targets (API <100ms)"
```

## Implementation Options

### Option 1: Progressive Only (RECOMMENDED START)

**Cost:** ~$0.30-0.45 per story
**Time:** +5-10 min per story (saves 1-2 hours in fixes)
**ROI:** 10-20x

```yaml
qa:
  progressive_review:
    enabled: true
  background_review:
    enabled: false
```

**Best for:** Most stories, 3-10 tasks, 2-8 hour development

### Option 2: Progressive + Background

**Cost:** ~$0.65-1.00 per story
**Time:** +5-10 min per story (saves 2-4 hours)
**ROI:** 40-80x

```yaml
qa:
  progressive_review:
    enabled: true
  background_review:
    enabled: true
    auto_start_conditions:
      min_tasks: 8
```

**Best for:** Long builds, 10+ tasks, security-critical code

### Option 3: Progressive + Pre-Commit Hook

**Cost:** ~$0.45-0.60 per story
**Time:** +10 min per story
**ROI:** 15-30x

Use progressive reviews + your pre-commit hook script.

**Best for:** Teams with multiple devs, want defense in depth

## Expected Results

### After 5 Stories

You should see:
- ‚úÖ 70-90% of issues caught before final QA
- ‚úÖ 5x faster fix time per issue
- ‚úÖ Higher code quality
- ‚úÖ Developer learning curve (fewer repeated mistakes)
- ‚úÖ Faster story completion (less rework)

### Red Flags (Time to Adjust)

- ‚ùå <50% of issues caught ‚Üí Tune prompts, adjust thresholds
- ‚ùå >30% false positives ‚Üí Increase severity for blocking
- ‚ùå Developer frustration ‚Üí Too many blocks, reduce strictness
- ‚ùå Missing critical issues ‚Üí Enhance review prompts with project context

## Cost Analysis

### Per Story

| Approach | API Calls | Cost | Time Saved | ROI |
|----------|-----------|------|------------|-----|
| None (current) | 1 (final QA) | $0.15 | - | - |
| Progressive | 10-15 | $0.45 | 1.5 hrs | 20x |
| Background | 30-50 | $1.20 | 2.5 hrs | 60x |
| Pre-commit | 1-3 | $0.20 | 30 min | 8x |

### Per Epic (10 stories)

| Approach | Cost | Time Saved | Developer Hours Saved |
|----------|------|------------|---------------------|
| Progressive | $4.50 | 15 hours | $750 @ $50/hr |
| Background | $12.00 | 25 hours | $1,250 @ $50/hr |

**Conclusion:** Even background reviews (most expensive) have 100x ROI.

## What to Ignore

Your pre-commit hook has these features that you DON'T need in progressive review:

1. ‚ùå **Git hook installation** - Progressive reviews run during dev workflow, not on commit
2. ‚ùå **Diff parsing** - We review changed files, not git diffs (more context)
3. ‚ùå **Binary blocking** - We have PASS/CONCERNS/BLOCK (more nuanced)
4. ‚ùå **Score calculation** - We use severity-based decisions (clearer)

Keep your hook as a safety net, but progressive reviews are the primary defense.

## Next Steps

## Questions?

**Q: Should I use progressive or background reviews?**
A: Start with progressive. Add background if stories consistently take 8+ hours.

**Q: Will this slow down development?**
A: Adds 5-10 min per story, saves 1-2 hours in rework. Net time savings.

**Q: What if the AI review is wrong?**
A: Developer can override CONCERNS (not BLOCK). Track false positives and adjust prompts.

**Q: How do I integrate with existing QA workflow?**
A: Progressive reviews happen BEFORE final QA. QA agent references progressive findings.

**Q: Can I disable for certain stories?**
A: Yes, set `enabled: false` in config or skip for specific task types.

**Q: What about API costs?**
A: ~$0.45 per story. Saves $50-100 in developer time. 100x ROI.

## Your Original Pre-Commit Hook

Keep it! Use it as a **safety net**:

```
Progressive reviews (catches 80% of issues early)
  ‚Üì
Pre-commit hook (catches anything that slipped through)
  ‚Üì
Final QA review (comprehensive validation)
```

This defense-in-depth approach gives you:
1. **Fast feedback** (progressive)
2. **Commit safety** (pre-commit hook)
3. **Comprehensive validation** (final QA)

## Conclusion

You identified a real problem: code review happens too late in BMAD workflow.

**Solution:** Progressive task-level reviews
- Integrates natively with BMAD
- Provides immediate feedback
- Uses your CLAUDE.md for HomeIQ-specific checks
- 20x ROI minimum

**Action:** Add config, test on one story, measure results.

The infrastructure is ready to use. Start small, measure results, iterate.

Good luck! üöÄ
