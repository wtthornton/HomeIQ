### 7. Story AI5.5: Weekly/Monthly Aggregation Layer ✅
**File:** `services/ai-automation-service/src/clients/pattern_aggregate_client.py`

**Changes:**
- ✅ Added `write_session_weekly()` method (Group B detector)
- ✅ Added `write_day_type_weekly()` method (Group B detector)
- ✅ Added `write_contextual_monthly()` method (Group C detector)
