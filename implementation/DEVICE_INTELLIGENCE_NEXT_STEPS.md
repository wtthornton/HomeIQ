## Next Steps - User Actions Required

### Step 1: Recreate Database Tables

The database schema has been updated. You must recreate the tables to apply changes.

**Option A: Using the Python Script (Recommended)**

```bash
cd services/device-intelligence-service
python scripts/recreate_database.py
```

**Option B: Using the API**

1. Start the service:
   ```bash
   cd services/device-intelligence-service
   python -m src.main
   ```

2. Call the recreate endpoint:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8007/api/admin/database/recreate-tables
   ```

**Option C: Using curl**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8007/api/admin/database/recreate-tables
```

### Step 2: Restart the Device Intelligence Service

After recreating tables, restart the service to ensure it picks up the new schema:

```bash
# If running via Docker
docker-compose restart device-intelligence-service

# If running directly
cd services/device-intelligence-service
python -m src.main
```

### Step 3: Run Device Discovery

Trigger the discovery service to populate devices with the new fields:

```bash
# Via API
curl -X POST http://localhost:8007/api/discovery/force-refresh

# Or wait for automatic discovery (runs every 5 minutes)
```

### Step 4: Verify Results

Check the database to verify fields are populated:

```sql
-- Check a sample of devices
SELECT name, manufacturer, model, integration, area_name, device_class, is_battery_powered
FROM devices
LIMIT 10;
```

Or via API:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8007/api/discovery/devices
```

### Step 5: Check Debug Logs (Optional)

View the debug logs to see what Home Assistant returns:

```bash
# Look for lines like:
# Device {name}: manufacturer={manufacturer}, integration={integration}
```

This helps diagnose why some devices might show "Unknown" values.

---

## Expected Results

After completing the steps above, you should see:

### In the Database

- ✅ `manufacturer` = actual manufacturer (e.g., "Signify Netherlands B.V.") or "Unknown"
- ✅ `model` = actual model number or "Unknown"
- ✅ `integration` = correct integration name (e.g., "hue") or "unknown"
- ✅ `area_name` = correct area name (e.g., "office") or NULL
- ✅ `device_class` = device type (e.g., "light", "sensor") or NULL
- ✅ `is_battery_powered` = true/false based on power source
- ✅ `config_entry_id` = HA config entry ID or NULL
- ✅ `connections_json` = physical connections as JSON or NULL
- ✅ `identifiers_json` = device identifiers as JSON or NULL

### Notes on "Unknown" Values

The analysis document indicates that some devices (like "Sun") genuinely don't have manufacturer data in Home Assistant's device registry. This is expected behavior and not a bug. The debug logging will help confirm whether a device showing "Unknown" actually has no data in HA or if there's an issue with data flow.

## API Endpoints Available

### Database Management

- `POST /api/admin/database/recreate-tables` - Recreate all tables
- `GET /api/admin/database/status` - Get database status
- `GET /api/admin/database/` - Get API information

### Discovery

- `POST /api/discovery/force-refresh` - Trigger device discovery
- `GET /api/discovery/devices` - Get all discovered devices
- `GET /api/discovery/status` - Get discovery service status

---

## Troubleshooting

### If you see "Database not initialized"

1. Make sure the service is running
2. Check that database configuration is correct
3. Verify the database file exists and is writable

### If fields still show "Unknown"

1. Check the debug logs to see what HA returns
2. Verify that the devices actually have data in HA's device registry
3. Some built-in entities (Sun, Home Assistant Core) don't have manufacturer data

### If you encounter import errors

1. Ensure you're running from the correct directory
2. Check that all dependencies are installed
3. Verify the Python path is correct

## Summary

All code changes are complete and ready for testing. The next steps are:

1. ✅ Code changes implemented
2. ⏳ Recreate database tables (USER ACTION)
3. ⏳ Restart the service (USER ACTION)
4. ⏳ Run discovery (USER ACTION)
5. ⏳ Verify results (USER ACTION)

After completing these steps, the device intelligence database will contain richer metadata with proper field population.
