- **Pandas Optimizations** - Vectorized operations, memory optimization
- **Performance Tracking** - Statistics and monitoring

### **2. SequenceDetector** ✅
- **Purpose**: Detects multi-step behavior patterns
- **Example**: "Coffee maker → Kitchen light → Music" sequences
- **Features**:
  - Rolling window analysis (30-minute windows)

  - Presence detection (home/away status)
  - Time context (time of day, season, day type)
  - Environmental factors (daylight, activity level)
  - ML clustering for contextual patterns

### **4. Pipeline Integration** ✅
- **3AM Batch Process**: Integrated new detectors into daily analysis
- **Parallel Processing**: Both detectors run alongside existing ones
