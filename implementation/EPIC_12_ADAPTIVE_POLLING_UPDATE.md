# Epic 12 Update: Adaptive Polling Strategy
## State-Driven ESPN Monitoring for HA Automations

**Updated**: 2025-10-14  
**Status**: ‚úÖ Epic 12 Reopened and Enhanced  
**New Feature**: Adaptive state machine polling (12h ‚Üí 5min ‚Üí 5sec)

---

## ‚úÖ **What Was Updated**

### **Epic 12 Status Change**

**Before**:
```
Status: ‚úÖ COMPLETE (Implemented via Epic 13 Story 13.4)
Reality: Nothing was actually implemented
Problem: Epic marked done but code shows otherwise
```

**After**:
```
Status: üîÑ IN PROGRESS
Reality: Phase 0 (Epic 11 cache) complete, Phases 1-3 pending
Clarity: Epic correctly reflects actual implementation state
```

---

## üéØ **Adaptive Polling Strategy Added**

### **Your Brilliant Idea**

Instead of checking ESPN every 15 seconds 24/7, use a **state machine** that adapts to game proximity:

```
State 1: NO_GAME_SOON
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚ñ∫ Check schedule every 12 hours
      ‚Üì Game detected within 1 hour
      
State 2: PRE_GAME  
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚ñ∫ Check game time every 5 minutes
      ‚Üì Game within 5 minutes
      
State 3: GAME_IMMINENT
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚ñ∫ Check status every 5 seconds
      ‚Üì Game status = "live"
      
State 4: GAME_LIVE
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚ñ∫ Check score every 5 seconds (catch every score!)
      ‚Üì Game status = "final"
      
State 5: POST_GAME
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚ñ∫ Stop monitoring, return to 12h checks
```

## üìä **ESPN API Efficiency Comparison**

### **Game Day (4-Hour NFL Game)**

| Strategy | ESPN Calls | Efficiency |
|----------|------------|------------|
| **Fixed 15s (24/7)** | 5,760 calls | Baseline |
| **Smart Schedule (game hours)** | 4,800 calls | 17% better |
| **Your Adaptive** ‚≠ê | **2,954 calls** | **49% better!** |

**Your Strategy Breakdown**:
```
12h schedule checks:    2 calls
1h pre-game (5min):    12 calls
5min imminent (5sec):  60 calls
4h live game (5sec): 2,880 calls
Total:              2,954 calls
```

---

### **Off Day (No Games)**

| Strategy | ESPN Calls | Efficiency |
|----------|------------|------------|
| **Fixed 15s (24/7)** | 5,760 calls | Baseline |
| **Smart Schedule** | 100 calls | 98% better |
| **Your Adaptive** ‚≠ê | **2 calls** | **99.97% better!** |

**Your Strategy**: Only checks schedule twice per day (12h intervals)

---

### **Annual Comparison**

**Typical NFL Season** (17 games):
```
Fixed 15s (24/7):     2.1 million calls/year
Smart schedule:       260,000 calls/year
Your adaptive:        51,000 calls/year ‚≠ê

Your savings: 97.6% fewer calls than fixed intervals!
```

## ‚ö° **Latency for HA Automations**

### **"Flash Lights When Team Scores"**

**Timeline**:
```
14:23:00 - Touchdown scored on field
14:23:10 - ESPN API updates with new score (10s ESPN lag)
14:23:15 - Our 5-second check detects change (0-5s)
14:23:15 - Webhook sent to Home Assistant (instant)
14:23:16 - HA automation triggers
14:23:16 - Living room lights flash! üéâ

Total latency: 11-16 seconds from actual score
```

**Why This is Excellent**:
- ‚úÖ Feels instant to user (under 20 seconds)
- ‚úÖ Catches every scoring play (5s checks during game)
- ‚úÖ Much better than 30s polling (20-40s latency)
- ‚úÖ Perfect for home automation use case

---

## üìã **Updated Epic 12 Structure**

### **Phase 0: Foundation** (Epic 11 - COMPLETE ‚úÖ)
- ESPN API integration
- In-memory cache (15s/5min/1h TTLs)
- Dashboard sports tab
- Basic live/upcoming game display

### **Phase 1: InfluxDB Persistence** (Story 12.1 - 2 weeks)
**Goal**: Store all ESPN data for historical queries

**Deliverables**:
- Async InfluxDB writer (non-blocking)
- Schema: `nfl_scores`, `nhl_scores` measurements
- 2-year retention policy
- Write on every ESPN fetch

**ESPN Impact**: No change (dashboard-driven polling continues)

---

### **Phase 2: Historical Query APIs** (Story 12.2 - 3 weeks)
**Goal**: Enable external analytics platforms to query data

**Deliverables**:
- GET `/api/v1/sports/games/history`
- GET `/api/v1/sports/games/timeline/{id}`
- GET `/api/v1/sports/teams/{team}/stats`
- Fast queries (<500ms)

**ESPN Impact**: No change (queries use InfluxDB, not ESPN)

---

### **Phase 3: Adaptive Monitor + Webhooks** (Story 12.3 - 4 weeks) ‚≠ê

**Goal**: Enable HA automations with instant event triggers

**Deliverables**:
- Adaptive state machine (12h ‚Üí 5min ‚Üí 5sec)
- Event detection (game_start, score_change, game_end)
- HMAC-signed webhook delivery
- Fast HA status APIs (<50ms)
- Webhook registration system

**ESPN Impact**: 
- Game day: 2,954 calls (adaptive)
- Off day: 2 calls (12h schedule)
- **97.6% more efficient than fixed intervals!**

**Primary Use Cases**:
1. ‚ö° Flash lights when team scores (11-16s latency)
2. üè† Activate game day scene on start
3. üì± Send notifications on game events
4. üéØ HA conditional logic (fast status API)

## üéØ **Quick Reference: Adaptive Intervals**

### **State Machine Configuration**

```python
class AdaptiveIntervals:
    """Epic 12 Phase 3 intervals"""
    
    # State: NO_GAME_SOON (default)
    SCHEDULE_CHECK = 43200  # 12 hours
    
    # State: PRE_GAME (1h before)
    PRE_GAME_CHECK = 300    # 5 minutes
    
    # State: GAME_IMMINENT (5min before)  
    IMMINENT_CHECK = 5      # 5 seconds
    
    # State: GAME_LIVE (during game)
    LIVE_CHECK = 5          # 5 seconds
    
    # State: POST_GAME
    POST_COOLDOWN = 300     # 5 minutes, then stop
```

### **ESPN Call Budget**

| Scenario | Calls/Day | Calls/Week | Calls/Year |
|----------|-----------|------------|------------|
| **Off-season** | 2 | 14 | 730 |
| **Single game week** | 2,956 | 2,956 | - |
| **17-game NFL season** | Avg 140 | - | 51,000 |
| **82-game NHL season** | Avg 800 | - | 293,000 |
| **Both sports** | Avg 970 | - | 344,000 |

**All within reasonable limits for free ESPN API** ‚úÖ
