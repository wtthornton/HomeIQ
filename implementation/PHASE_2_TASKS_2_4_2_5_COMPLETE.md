**Tasks:** Task 2.4 (Sequence Support) + Task 2.5 (Enhanced Component Restoration)

## Summary

## ✅ Task 2.4: Sequence Support for Test Stage

### Implementation Details

**Goal:** Extend test stage to support sequence testing with shortened delays (target: 60% testable)

**Changes Made:**

1. **Sequence Detection Logic** (`ask_ai_router.py:1537-1563`)
   - Detects delays and repeats in suggestions before test generation
   - Determines if automation has sequences that can be tested

2. **Mode Selection** (`ask_ai_router.py:1550-1563`)
   - **Sequence Mode**: For automations with delays/repeats
     - Shortens delays by 10x (e.g., 2 seconds → 0.2 seconds)
     - Reduces repeat counts (e.g., 5 times → 2 times)
     - Keeps sequences intact for faster testing
   - **Simple Mode**: For basic automations
     - Strips timing components completely

3. **Enhanced YAML Generation Prompt** (`ask_ai_router.py:378-399`)
   - Detects `test_mode: 'sequence'` flag
   - Provides specific instructions for shortened delays in prompt
   - Guides OpenAI to generate test YAML with 10x faster execution

### Example Flow

**Original Automation:**
```
"Flash office lights 5 times with 2-second delays when door opens"
```

**Test Mode (Sequence):**
```
- Trigger: Event trigger (immediate)
- Action: Flash lights 2 times with 0.2-second delays
- Result: Same pattern, 10x faster for quick preview
```

### Files Modified

- `services/ai-automation-service/src/api/ask_ai_router.py`
  - Lines 1537-1563: Sequence detection and mode selection
  - Lines 378-399: Enhanced prompt for sequence test mode

## ✅ Task 2.5: Enhanced Component Restoration

### Implementation Details

**Goal:** Enhance component restoration with nested component support and intent validation

**Changes Made:**

1. **Nested Component Detection** (`ask_ai_router.py:1785-1806`)
   - Analyzes component relationships to identify nesting
   - Detects delays within repeat blocks
   - Separates nested vs. simple components for targeted restoration

2. **Enhanced Restoration Prompt** (`ask_ai_router.py:1808-1850`)
   - Includes component confidence scores
   - Adds nesting information when nested components detected
   - Provides structured restoration steps
   - Requests intent validation in response

3. **Enhanced Return Data** (`ask_ai_router.py:1872-1882`)
   - `nested_components_restored`: List of nested components
   - `restoration_structure`: Component hierarchy description
   - `intent_match`: Boolean validation flag
   - `intent_validation`: Explanation of intent matching

4. **Updated Approve Endpoint** (`ask_ai_router.py:1983-1987`)
   - Includes all enhanced restoration fields in response
   - Provides complete restoration information to frontend

### Example Restoration

**Detected Components:**
- `delay: "2 seconds"` (nested - within repeat)
- `repeat: "3 times"` (contains delay)

**Restoration Result:**
```json
{
  "restored_components": ["delay", "repeat"],
  "nested_components_restored": ["delay"],
  "restoration_structure": "delay: 2s within repeat: 3 times",
  "intent_match": true,
  "intent_validation": "Delays are correctly nested within repeat block as specified in original query"
}
```

### Files Modified

- `services/ai-automation-service/src/api/ask_ai_router.py`
  - Lines 1734-1752: Enhanced function docstring
  - Lines 1785-1806: Nesting analysis logic
  - Lines 1808-1850: Enhanced restoration prompt
  - Lines 1856-1858: Enhanced system message
  - Lines 1863: Increased max_tokens (300 → 500)
  - Lines 1872-1882: Enhanced return structure
  - Lines 1983-1987: Enhanced approve endpoint response

---

## Integration Points

### Test Endpoint Response

The test endpoint now includes:
- `stripped_components`: List of components removed/shortened
- `test_mode`: Either `'sequence'` or `'simple'`
- When in sequence mode: Components are shortened, not removed

### Approve Endpoint Response

The approve endpoint now includes:
- `restoration_log`: Detailed restoration steps
- `restored_components`: List of restored components
- `restoration_confidence`: Confidence score (0.0-1.0)
- **NEW:** `nested_components_restored`: Nested components list
- **NEW:** `restoration_structure`: Component hierarchy
- **NEW:** `intent_match`: Intent validation result
- **NEW:** `intent_validation`: Intent validation explanation

## Testing Recommendations

### Task 2.4: Sequence Support Testing

1. **Test with Simple Automation:**
   - Query: "Turn on bedroom lights when door opens"
   - Expected: Simple mode (strips timing)
   - Verify: No delays/repeats in test YAML

2. **Test with Sequence Automation:**
   - Query: "Flash office lights 5 times with 2-second delays when door opens"
   - Expected: Sequence mode (shortens delays)
   - Verify: Test YAML has shortened delays (0.2s) and reduced repeats (2x)

3. **Test Sequence Execution:**
   - Trigger test automation
   - Verify: Lights flash with shortened timing
   - Verify: Pattern is preserved but faster

### Task 2.5: Restoration Testing

1. **Test Simple Restoration:**
   - Test automation with single delay
   - Approve automation
   - Verify: Delay restored in final YAML
   - Verify: `intent_match: true`

2. **Test Nested Restoration:**
   - Test automation with delay within repeat
   - Approve automation
   - Verify: Both delay and repeat restored
   - Verify: `nested_components_restored` includes delay
   - Verify: `restoration_structure` describes hierarchy

3. **Test Intent Validation:**
   - Original query: "Flash lights 3 times with 1-second delays"
   - Approve automation
   - Verify: `intent_validation` explains how restoration matches intent

## Metrics to Track

### Task 2.4 Targets
- **Sequence Testable Rate**: Target 60%+ of complex automations can be tested
- **Test Execution Time**: Sequence tests should complete 10x faster than full automation

### Task 2.5 Targets
- **Restoration Accuracy**: Target 95%+ of components correctly restored
- **Nested Component Detection**: Target 90%+ accuracy in detecting nested components
- **Intent Match Rate**: Target 95%+ of restorations match user intent

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Test Result Storage**: Currently `test_result` is `None` in approve endpoint (TODO: Store test history)
2. **Sequence Mode Detection**: Relies on description analysis - may miss complex patterns
3. **Nesting Detection**: Simple pattern matching - may not detect all nesting scenarios

---

## Next Steps

1. **Integration Testing**: Test both features end-to-end
2. **Frontend Updates**: Update UI to display new restoration fields
3. **Test History**: Implement test result storage for better restoration
4. **Metrics Collection**: Add monitoring for testable rate and restoration accuracy
5. **Documentation**: Update API documentation with new response fields
