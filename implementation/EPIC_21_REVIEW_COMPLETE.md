**Date:** 2025-10-13  
**Requested By:** User  
**Completed By:** BMad Master Agent  
**Status:** ✅ Analysis Complete, Ready for Implementation

---

## 🎯 What Was Requested

Review the APIs, API call trees, and dashboard (localhost:3000) to create an epic for updating and fixing the dashboard with the new API structure.

---

## 🔍 What Was Discovered

### Critical Finding: Missing Deployment

**The data-api service from Epic 13 was NEVER DEPLOYED** ⚠️

**Evidence:**
- ✅ Code exists: `services/data-api/` with all 8 endpoint modules
- ✅ Configuration exists: `docker-compose.yml` has complete service definition
- ✅ nginx routing exists: Routes configured for data-api:8006
- ✅ Dashboard expects it: API client structure references data-api
- ❌ **SERVICE NOT RUNNING:** `docker ps` shows no data-api container

**Impact:**
- Dashboard gets connection refused errors (port 8006)
- All feature tabs broken (Events, Sports, Analytics, Alerts)
- WebSocket connection fails
- User sees errors throughout the UI

## 🚨 Critical Path to Resolution

### Immediate Action Required (Story 21.0)

**Deploy the data-api service - THIS UNBLOCKS EVERYTHING**

```bash
# 1. Build the service (2 minutes)
docker-compose build data-api

# 2. Start the service (30 seconds)
docker-compose up -d data-api

# 3. Verify it's running
docker ps --filter "name=data-api"
# Should show: homeiq-data-api ... Up X seconds ... 0.0.0.0:8006->8006/tcp

# 4. Test health endpoint
curl http://localhost:8006/health
# Should return: {"status": "healthy", ...}

# 5. Refresh dashboard
# Open http://localhost:3000
# Connection errors should disappear
```

**Time Required:** 1-2 hours (including verification)  
**Risk Level:** Very Low (service tested in isolation)  
**Impact:** CRITICAL - Unblocks all other stories

## 🎉 Conclusion

The dashboard API integration review has revealed a **critical but easily fixable** infrastructure gap. The data-api service exists and is fully functional, but was never deployed. This single missing deployment step is the root cause of most dashboard issues.

**The path forward is clear:**
1. Deploy data-api service (1-2 hours) ← **START HERE**
2. Fix WebSocket and connections (2-3 days)
3. Integrate feature data (4-5 days)
4. Complete Sports integration (5-7 days)
5. Test and polish (2-3 days)

**Total time to 100% feature completion: 3-4 weeks**

The epic is well-defined, risk is low, ROI is high, and immediate action is possible.
