## 🚨 Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation | Status |
|------|--------|------------|--------|
| Animation performance on low-end devices | Medium | GPU acceleration + prefers-reduced-motion | ✅ Mitigated |
| Layout shift during skeleton→content transition | Medium | Match skeleton layouts to final content | ⏳ In Progress |
| Inconsistent application of design system | Low | Component audit checklist | 📝 Planned |
| Mobile issues not caught until device testing | Medium | Test on actual devices early | 📝 Planned |

**BMAD Agent Workflow:**
- Following @dev agent methodology
- Story-driven development
- Incremental testing and validation
- Documentation as we go

**User Feedback:**
- Initial skeleton components look great
- Shimmer effect is smooth
- Dark mode working well
- Need to complete integration for full effect
