# Fixes Applied - October 14, 2025

**Applied By:** BMAD Master  
**Purpose:** Pre-rebuild fixes based on comprehensive system review  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED (awaiting production compose decision)

---

## Summary

I have applied **2 critical fixes** and **documented 1 issue** requiring your decision before proceeding with the rebuild.

**Changes Made:**
- ✅ Fixed service dependencies
- ✅ Created root .dockerignore
- 📋 Documented production compose issue

**Changes NOT Made (require approval):**
- ❌ Did NOT execute Docker rebuild (destructive, needs approval)
- ❌ Did NOT modify docker-compose.prod.yml (needs decision on approach)

---

## ✅ Fix #1: Service Dependencies

### Issue
`admin-api` service was missing `data-api` in its dependencies, causing potential race conditions on startup.

### File Modified
`docker-compose.yml` (lines 182-191)

### Changes Applied
```yaml
# BEFORE:
depends_on:
  influxdb:
    condition: service_healthy
  websocket-ingestion:
    condition: service_healthy
  enrichment-pipeline:
    condition: service_healthy

# AFTER:
depends_on:
  influxdb:
    condition: service_healthy
  websocket-ingestion:
    condition: service_healthy
  enrichment-pipeline:
    condition: service_healthy
  data-api:                    # ← ADDED
    condition: service_healthy  # ← ADDED
```

### Impact
- ✅ Prevents admin-api from starting before data-api is ready
- ✅ Ensures proper service startup order
- ✅ Eliminates race condition risks

### Testing
```bash
# Verify the fix
grep -A 8 "admin-api:" docker-compose.yml | grep -A 6 "depends_on:"

# Should show data-api in the list
```

---

## ✅ Fix #2: Root .dockerignore

### Issue
No root-level `.dockerignore` file, causing larger build contexts and slower builds.

### File Created
`.dockerignore` (new file at project root)

### Contents
Excludes:
- ✅ Git files (`.git/`, `.gitignore`)
- ✅ Documentation (`docs/`, `implementation/`, `*.md`)
- ✅ Tests (`tests/`, `test-reports/`, `test-results/`)
- ✅ Environment files (`.env*`, keeping templates)
- ✅ Build artifacts (`node_modules/`, `__pycache__/`)
- ✅ IDE files (`.vscode/`, `.idea/`)
- ✅ Logs (`*.log`, `logs/`)
- ✅ Temporary files (`tmp/`, `temp/`)
- ✅ Backups (`*backup*/`, `*.backup`)
- ✅ Database files (`*.db`, `*.sqlite`)
- ✅ Screenshots (`*.png`, `*.jpg`)

### Impact
- ✅ Reduces Docker build context size
- ✅ Faster image builds
- ✅ Prevents accidental inclusion of sensitive files
- ✅ More efficient layer caching

### Testing
```bash
# Verify the file exists
ls -la .dockerignore

# Test build context size (before rebuild)
docker build --no-cache --dry-run . 2>&1 | grep "Sending build context"
```

## 📋 Fix #3: Production Compose (DOCUMENTED)

### Issue
`docker-compose.prod.yml` is **missing 8 services** including the critical `data-api` service.

**Missing Services:**
1. ❌ **data-api** (port 8006) - **CRITICAL**
2. ❌ log-aggregator (port 8015)
3. ❌ sports-data (port 8005)
4. ❌ carbon-intensity (port 8010)
5. ❌ electricity-pricing (port 8011)
6. ❌ air-quality (port 8012)
7. ❌ calendar (port 8013)
8. ❌ smart-meter (port 8014)

### Status
**⏸️ AWAITING DECISION**

### Options Provided

**Option A: Use Main Compose (RECOMMENDED)**
- Use `docker-compose.yml` for production
- All services included
- Add production hardening later if needed

**Option B: Merge Files**
- Create complete production compose
- Time: 2-3 hours
- Includes all services + production features

**Option C: Enhance Main Compose**
- Add production features to main compose
- Single source of truth
- Time: 1-2 hours

### Documentation Created
📄 `implementation/DOCKER_COMPOSE_PROD_ISSUE.md`
- Complete analysis
- Comparison table
- Three solution options with pros/cons
- Implementation steps for each option

### Recommendation
**Use Option A** (main compose) for now:
1. Complete feature set
2. Tested configuration
3. Lower risk
4. Can add hardening after successful rebuild

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (You Can Do Now)

1. **Review Changes**
   ```bash
   # Review service dependency fix
   git diff docker-compose.yml
   
   # Review new .dockerignore
   cat .dockerignore
   ```

2. **Validate Configuration**
   ```bash
   # Check docker-compose syntax
   docker-compose config > /dev/null
   echo "Status: $?"  # Should be 0
   ```

3. **Decide on Production Compose**
   Read: `implementation/DOCKER_COMPOSE_PROD_ISSUE.md`
   Choose: Option A, B, or C

### After Production Compose Decision

4. **Create Backup** (from rebuild plan Phase 1)
   ```bash
   # Backup InfluxDB
   docker exec ha-ingestor-influxdb influx backup /tmp/backup
   docker cp ha-ingestor-influxdb:/tmp/backup ~/backup-influxdb
   
   # Backup SQLite
   docker cp ha-ingestor-data-api:/app/data/metadata.db ~/backup-metadata.db
   
   # Backup environment
   cp .env ~/backup-env
   ```

5. **Execute Rebuild** (from rebuild plan Phase 2-4)
   ```bash
   # Complete teardown
   docker-compose down --timeout 30
   docker ps -a --filter "name=ha-ingestor" -q | xargs -r docker rm -f
   docker images --filter=reference='*ha-ingestor*' -q | xargs -r docker rmi -f
   docker network rm ha-ingestor-network 2>/dev/null || true
   docker builder prune -a -f
   
   # Rebuild from scratch
   docker-compose build --no-cache --parallel
   
   # Deploy
   docker-compose up -d
   
   # Validate
   docker-compose ps
   curl http://localhost:3000
   ```

---

## Verification Commands

### Before Rebuild
```bash
# 1. Verify fixes applied
git status
git diff docker-compose.yml
ls -la .dockerignore

# 2. Validate Docker Compose syntax
docker-compose config > /dev/null && echo "✅ Config valid"

# 3. Check current system status
docker-compose ps
```

### After Rebuild
```bash
# 1. Verify all services healthy
docker-compose ps | grep -c "Up (healthy)"
# Should show 13+

# 2. Test all health endpoints
./scripts/test-services.sh

# 3. Verify dashboard
curl -I http://localhost:3000
# Should show "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"

# 4. Check HA connection
docker-compose logs websocket-ingestion | grep "Connected"
# Should show "Connected to Home Assistant"
```

---

## Rollback Procedure (If Needed)

If anything goes wrong, rollback is simple:

```bash
# 1. Revert docker-compose.yml changes
git checkout docker-compose.yml

# 2. Remove .dockerignore (optional)
rm .dockerignore

# 3. Restart services (if they're running)
docker-compose restart
```

**Note:** No destructive changes were made, so rollback is safe and easy.

## Questions & Answers

### Q: Are these changes safe?
**A:** Yes. Changes made are:
- ✅ Adding a dependency (safety improvement)
- ✅ Creating a build optimization file (no runtime impact)
- ✅ No changes to running services
- ✅ Easily reversible

### Q: Do I need to restart services?
**A:** Not yet. Changes take effect on next:
- `docker-compose up` (for dependency fix)
- `docker-compose build` (for .dockerignore)

### Q: Should I commit these changes?
**A:** **Yes**, recommended:
```bash
git add docker-compose.yml .dockerignore
git commit -m "fix: Add data-api dependency to admin-api, create root .dockerignore"
```

### Q: What about the production compose issue?
**A:** **Decision required.** See options in:
`implementation/DOCKER_COMPOSE_PROD_ISSUE.md`

### Q: Can I proceed with rebuild now?
**A:** **Yes**, but:
1. Decide on production compose strategy first
2. Create backups
3. Follow rebuild plan Phase 2+
