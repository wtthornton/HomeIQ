## 🎯 How It Works

### Create Automation from NL
1. User types: "Turn on kitchen light at 7 AM"
2. Clicks "Generate Automation"
3. AI calls OpenAI with device context
4. Validates safety
5. Creates suggestion (appears in list below)
6. User reviews YAML
7. Clicks "Approve & Deploy"
8. Safety validation runs
9. Deploys to HA if safe
10. Shows success with safety score

### Rollback Flow
1. User has deployed automation
2. Automation misbehaves
3. Click "Rollback to Previous Version"
4. Enter reason
5. Previous version restored
6. HA updated automatically
