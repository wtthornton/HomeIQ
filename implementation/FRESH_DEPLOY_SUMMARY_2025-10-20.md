## Issues Found and Resolved

### ✅ FIXED: Weather API - InfluxDB Bucket Missing

**Issue:** Weather API couldn't write data  
**Cause:** `weather_data` bucket didn't exist in fresh InfluxDB  
**Fix Applied:** Created bucket with infinite retention  
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

```bash
# Command executed:
docker exec homeiq-influxdb influx bucket create -n weather_data -o ha-ingestor -r 0
```

**Result:** Bucket created successfully  
**Next Weather Update:** Will write successfully on next fetch cycle (~15 min intervals)

## Outstanding Warnings (Non-Blocking)

### ⚠️ Setup Service - Admin API Integration

**Impact:** Integration health check showing 2/6 integrations healthy  
**Severity:** Warning (service functional)  
**Action Required:** Investigate network connectivity to Admin API

**To Investigate:**
```bash
# Check if Admin API is accessible from setup service
docker exec homeiq-setup-service curl http://homeiq-admin:8004/health
```

---

### ⚠️ Smart Meter Service - Mock Data

**Impact:** Using mock data instead of real smart meter  
**Severity:** Warning (expected if no smart meter configured)  
**Action Required:** Configure Home Assistant credentials (optional)

**To Enable (if needed):**
Add to service environment:
```env
HOME_ASSISTANT_URL=http://192.168.1.86:8123
HOME_ASSISTANT_TOKEN=<long-lived-access-token>
```

---

### ⚠️ Carbon Intensity Service - No Credentials

**Impact:** Service in standby mode, no carbon data  
**Severity:** Warning (expected without WattTime account)  
**Action Required:** Add WattTime credentials (optional)

**To Enable (if needed):**
```env
WATTTIME_USERNAME=<username>
WATTTIME_PASSWORD=<password>
```

---

### ⚠️ Calendar Service - Entity Not Found

**Impact:** Calendar integration not functional  
**Severity:** Warning  
**Action Required:** Verify calendar exists in Home Assistant

**To Fix:**
1. Check if calendar integration is enabled in HA
2. Update `CALENDAR_ENTITY_ID` to correct entity name
3. Or create `calendar.primary` entity in HA

---

### ℹ️ AI Automation Service - Migration Skipped

**Impact:** None - service started successfully  
**Severity:** Informational  
**Action Required:** None (monitor for schema issues)

**Details:** Alembic migration dependency issue on fresh database (non-fatal)

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Optional)

1. **Monitor weather API** - Wait for next fetch cycle to confirm bucket fix
2. **Investigate Admin API integration** - Check setup service connectivity
3. **Configure optional services** - If smart meter/carbon/calendar needed

### Short-term Actions

4. **Review enrichment pipeline logging** - Reduce verbose WARNING logs
5. **Test all web interfaces** - Verify dashboard functionality
6. **Monitor event ingestion** - Confirm data flowing for 1 hour

### Long-term Actions

7. **Update init scripts** - Add weather_data bucket to InfluxDB initialization
8. **Document optional configurations** - Smart meter, carbon, calendar setup
9. **Performance baseline** - Establish metrics for fresh deployment
