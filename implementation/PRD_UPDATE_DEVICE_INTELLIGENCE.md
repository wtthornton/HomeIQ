| NFR13 | Combined batch analysis time | <15 minutes (pattern + feature) |
| NFR14 | Dashboard load time | <2 seconds |
| NFR15 | Incremental capability discovery | <30 seconds for new device |
| NFR16 | Scalability | Support 500+ devices from 20+ manufacturers |
| NFR17 | Resource overhead | +200MB memory maximum |

### 7. Section 2.3.1: Device Intelligence Compatibility Requirements

**Added 4 new requirements (CR6-CR9):**

| ID | Requirement | Purpose |
|----|-------------|---------|
| CR6 | Zigbee2MQTT compatibility | Read-only MQTT subscription, no config changes |
| CR7 | AI Automation Service enhancement | Additive tables/endpoints, backward compatible |
| CR8 | Health Dashboard integration | 13th tab, follows existing UI patterns |
| CR9 | Multi-integration architecture | Extensible for Z-Wave, native HA integrations |

### 8. Section 3.2.1: Device Intelligence UI

**Added comprehensive UI specification:**
- Location: 13th tab in Health Dashboard (not separate app)
- 5 sections: Utilization overview, manufacturer breakdown, opportunities, device table, recent activity
- Component reuse: 100% existing patterns (Card, Charts, Tables)
- Design consistency: Follows existing Health Dashboard patterns
- No new component patterns required

### 9. Section 5.4-5.5: Epic-AI-2 Structure

**Added Epic-AI-2 with 9 stories:**

| Story | Title | Effort | Focus |
|-------|-------|--------|-------|
| 2.1 | MQTT Capability Listener | 10-12h | Universal device discovery |
| 2.2 | Capability Database | 8-10h | Schema + storage |
| 2.3 | Device Matching Engine | 10-12h | Link devices to capabilities |
| 2.4 | Feature Suggestion Generator | 12-14h | LLM-based feature suggestions |
| 2.5 | Unified Suggestion Pipeline | 6-8h | Merge pattern + feature |
| 2.6 | Utilization Calculator & API | 8-10h | Metrics and endpoints |
| 2.7 | Device Intelligence Dashboard | 12-14h | Health Dashboard 13th tab |
| 2.8 | Manual Refresh & Context7 | 8-10h | Fallback for edge cases |
| 2.9 | Integration Testing | 10-12h | Multi-brand test coverage |

**Total:** 84-102 hours (2-3 weeks)

### 10. Section 6: Epic Summary

**Updated to show combined system:**
- Epic-AI-1: 18 stories, 160-192 hours (Pattern Automation)
- Epic-AI-2: 9 stories, 84-102 hours (Device Intelligence)
- **Total:** 27 stories, 244-294 hours (6-8 weeks total)
- **Phased approach:** Complete Epic-AI-1 first, then Epic-AI-2

## Key Achievements

### Universal Support (Critical Innovation)

**Before:** Example-driven (hard-coded Inovelli examples)  
**After:** Universal support for ALL Zigbee manufacturers via MQTT bridge

**Coverage:**
- ~6,000 Zigbee device models
- 100+ manufacturers
- Automatic population (no manual research)
- Real-time updates (new devices auto-discovered)

### Requirements Quality

**Comprehensive:**
- 20 functional requirements (FR1-FR20)
- 17 non-functional requirements (NFR1-NFR17)
- 9 compatibility requirements (CR1-CR9)

**Well-Scoped:**
- Clear Phase 1 (pattern) vs. Phase 2 (intelligence) separation
- Realistic effort estimates
- Dependencies explicitly stated
- Integration points documented

### Integration Approach

**Non-Breaking:**
- Enhances existing AI Automation Service (doesn't replace)
- Adds to existing Health Dashboard (13th tab)
- Additive database tables (no schema changes to existing)
- Backward compatible APIs
- Preserves existing pattern automation functionality

## What's Next

### Immediate Actions

1. **Review Updated PRD** - Stakeholder review of `docs/prd.md` v2.0
2. **Validate Epic Structure** - Confirm Epic-AI-2 stories are complete
3. **Handoff to Architect** - Architecture review of Device Intelligence design
4. **Story Refinement** - Detail out Story 2.1-2.9 as needed
5. **Begin Development** - Start with Epic-AI-1 completion, then Epic-AI-2

### Development Sequence

**Phase 1 (Epic-AI-1):**
- Complete remaining pattern automation stories
- Validate pattern suggestions work as expected
- Gather user feedback on pattern automation

**Phase 2 (Epic-AI-2):**
- Begin Story 2.1 (MQTT listener)
- Build universal capability discovery
- Integrate with pattern automation
- Deploy combined system
