#### Task 3-6: Additional Features (Future)
- ⏳ Clarification questions (when query ambiguous)
- ⏳ Improve NLP parser (backend improvement)
- ⏳ Performance optimization
- ⏳ Enhanced error handling

---

## 📊 What Users Can Do Now

### **Before This Implementation**
- Single queries only
- No context between messages
- Each query was independent

### **After This Implementation**
- ✅ **Multi-turn conversations** - Have natural back-and-forth with AI
- ✅ **Context-aware** - AI remembers devices mentioned earlier
- ✅ **Follow-up guidance** - Get suggestions on what to ask next
- ✅ **Context visibility** - See what's being discussed at a glance
- ✅ **Persistent conversations** - Resume after reloading page
- ✅ **Export/Import** - Share conversations or backup your work
- ✅ **Natural refinement** - Say "make it 6:30am instead" and it works

## 💡 Example Conversation Flow

```
User: "Flash my office lights when VGK scores"
AI: [Shows 3 suggestions]
    💡 Try asking:
      [Make it flash 5 times instead] [Use different colors] [Set brightness to 50%]

User: *clicks "Make it flash 5 times instead"*
AI: [Refines suggestions to flash 5 times]

🎛️ Context: office lights • 3 active suggestions • 2 mentions in this conversation

User: "Apply the first one"
AI: [Creates automation and confirms]
```

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing Required

#### Conversation History
- [ ] Send multiple messages
- [ ] Reload page, verify conversation persists
- [ ] Clear chat, reload page, verify starts fresh

#### Context Tracking
- [ ] Send "Flash office lights when VGK scores"
- [ ] Send "Make it 5 times instead"
- [ ] Verify context is passed to API (check network tab)

#### Follow-up Prompts
- [ ] Send a query about flashing lights
- [ ] Verify follow-up prompts appear
- [ ] Click a follow-up prompt, verify it inserts

#### Context Indicator
- [ ] Mention devices in conversation
- [ ] Verify context indicator shows correct devices
- [ ] Clear chat, verify indicator disappears

#### Export/Import
- [ ] Export conversation to JSON
- [ ] Clear chat
- [ ] Import the JSON file
- [ ] Verify conversation restores correctly

- **Context indicator component** - Reusable, clean separation

### Best Practices
- State management with useState hooks
- useEffect for side effects (localStorage, scrolling)
- Proper TypeScript interfaces for type safety
- Error handling with try/catch and toasts
- Component composition for reusability
