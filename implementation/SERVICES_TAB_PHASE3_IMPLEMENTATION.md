## 🎨 Design Patterns Used

### Pure CSS Layout
No external libraries needed! Uses Tailwind CSS and React:

```tsx
// Layered architecture with flexbox
<div className="flex justify-center mb-8">
  {/* Service Node */}
  <div className={`px-6 py-4 rounded-lg border-2 cursor-pointer transition-all
    ${getStatusColor(nodeId)}
    ${isHighlighted ? 'ring-4 ring-blue-500 scale-110' : 'hover:scale-105'}
  `}>
    <div className="text-3xl">{icon}</div>
    <div className="text-sm font-medium">{name}</div>
  </div>
</div>

// Connection arrows
<div className={`text-4xl ${getConnectionOpacity(from, to)}`}>↓</div>
```

### Interactive State Management
```typescript
const [selectedNode, setSelectedNode] = useState<string | null>(null);
const [hoveredNode, setHoveredNode] = useState<string | null>(null);

const handleNodeClick = (nodeId: string) => {
  setSelectedNode(selectedNode === nodeId ? null : nodeId);
};
```

### Hover Tooltips
```tsx
{hoveredNode === 'service-id' && (
  <div className="absolute top-full mt-2 z-10 px-3 py-2 rounded shadow-lg">
    <div className="text-xs">Tooltip content</div>
  </div>
)}
```

## 🔍 Service Relationship Details

### Core Flow (Vertical)
1. Home Assistant generates events
2. WebSocket Ingestion captures events
3. Enrichment Pipeline processes & enriches
4. InfluxDB stores time-series data

### External Enrichment (Horizontal)
All 6 external services feed data into Enrichment Pipeline:
- Weather conditions
- Carbon intensity data
- Electricity pricing
- Air quality measurements
- Calendar events
- Smart meter readings

### Admin & Monitoring (Parallel)
- Health Dashboard queries Admin API
- Admin API reads from InfluxDB
- Data Retention manages InfluxDB lifecycle
- All operate independently
