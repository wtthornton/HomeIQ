# Story 21.5: Alerts Tab Implementation - COMPLETE

**Date:** October 13, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE  
**Story:** Epic 21 - Story 21.5: Alerts Tab Implementation  
**BMAD Method Applied:** ✅ Story document created in `docs/stories/`

## Summary

Successfully implemented full alerts management functionality for the Alerts tab by integrating with data-api alert endpoints. Created TypeScript types, a custom useAlerts hook, and updated AlertsPanel to display real-time alerts with acknowledge/resolve actions. The tab now provides a complete alert management interface with filtering, status tracking, and action buttons.

## Work Completed (BMAD Compliant)

- Tasks breakdown with timeline
- Success metrics and risks
- Complete technical specification

**BMAD Value:** Permanent reference documentation for future maintenance and enhancements

### 2. Created Alert Types and Interfaces ✅

**File:** `services/health-dashboard/src/types/alerts.ts`

**Key Types:**
```typescript
- AlertSeverity: 'critical' | 'warning' | 'info'

3. Implementation notes in `implementation/` directory
4. Reference documentation in `docs/stories/`

### ✅ Test-Driven Verification
1. Verified API endpoints before frontend work
2. Tested each component incrementally
3. Validated data flow end-to-end
4. Documented testing results

### ✅ Quality Standards
1. TypeScript strict types throughout
2. Proper error handling with user feedback
3. Loading states for async operations
4. Accessible ARIA labels
5. Responsive design
6. Dark mode support
7. Performance optimizations (useMemo)

## Conclusion

Story 21.5 is **COMPLETE** following BMAD best practices. The Alerts tab now provides a full-featured alert management interface with:

✅ **Real API Integration:**
- Fetches alerts from `/api/v1/alerts`
