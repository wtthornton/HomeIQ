- ✅ Shadow depth increase on hover
- ✅ Smooth fade-in on mount (300ms)
- ✅ Content fade-in transitions

### Status & Badges
- ✅ Smooth status color transitions
- ✅ Badge animations with scaling
- ✅ Live pulse for active states
- ✅ Icon entrance animations

### Interactive Elements
- ✅ Button press feedback (scale 0.98)
- ✅ Button hover states with transitions

---

## 🚀 Performance Optimizations

### GPU Acceleration
- ✅ All animations use `transform` and `opacity` only
- ✅ `will-change` hints for animation performance
- ✅ `backface-visibility: hidden` for smoother animations
- ✅ `transform: translateZ(0)` for GPU compositing

### Accessibility
- ✅ `prefers-reduced-motion` support (disables all animations)
- ✅ Color contrast maintained in dark mode
- ✅ Keyboard navigation preserved
- ✅ Screen reader compatibility maintained

### Animation Timing
- **Fast interactions:** 200ms (buttons, icons)
- **Medium transitions:** 300ms (cards, tooltips)
- **Number counting:** 500ms (smooth value changes)
- **Stagger delay:** 50ms per item (subtle cascade)

## 🎯 Technical Highlights

### Number Counting Animation
```typescript
// 500ms smooth counter with 20 steps
const timer = setInterval(() => {
  currentStep++;
  if (currentStep === steps) {
    setDisplayValue(value);
    clearInterval(timer);
  } else {
    setDisplayValue(prev => prev + stepValue);
  }
}, duration / steps);
```

### Stagger Animation
```tsx
// 50ms delay per item for cascade effect
<div style={{ animationDelay: `${index * 0.05}s` }}>
  <ServiceCard />
</div>
```

### Live Pulse Indicator
```css
/* Pulse animation for live data */
.live-pulse {
  animation: live-pulse 2s ease-in-out infinite;
}

@keyframes live-pulse {
  0%, 100% { opacity: 1; }
  50% { opacity: 0.7; }
}
```
