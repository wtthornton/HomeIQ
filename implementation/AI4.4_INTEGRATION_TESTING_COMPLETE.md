## 🎓 What's Next

### For Review

1. **Monitor Debug Logs** - With `LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG`, you can now see:
   - HA client initialization
   - Automation fetching and parsing
   - Entity pair filtering
   - Detailed relationship checking

2. **Test Real HA Instance** - When network is configured:
   - HA client will connect to `http://192.168.1.86:8123`
   - Fetch existing automations
   - Filter redundant suggestions
   - Show only new opportunities

3. **Validate Synergy Quality** - Check that:
   - No redundant suggestions appear
   - Only genuinely new automations suggested
   - Filtering logs show which pairs were removed

### Deployment Checklist

- [x] Code complete and tested
- [x] Debug logging enabled for review
- [x] Service deployed and healthy
- [x] Configuration documented
- [x] All tests passing
- [ ] Network configuration (influxdb/data-api connectivity)
- [ ] Test with real HA instance
- [ ] Validate synergy quality in production
