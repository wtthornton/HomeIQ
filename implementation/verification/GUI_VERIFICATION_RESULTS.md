# 🔍 GUI Verification Results - Playwright Analysis

## ✅ **What's Working:**

1. **✅ Service Health & Dependencies**: Perfect display
   - admin-api: HEALTHY ✅
   - InfluxDB: healthy ✅  
   - WebSocket Ingestion: healthy ✅
   - Enrichment Pipeline: healthy ✅

2. **✅ API Endpoints**: All responding correctly
   - `/api/health`: Returns correct health data
   - `/api/stats`: Returns correct metrics (23 events/min, 290 total events)
   - 10 API requests made successfully

3. **✅ Dashboard Structure**: All components rendering
   - System Health cards: Present but showing wrong data
   - Key Metrics cards: Present but showing "0" values

## ❌ **Issues Identified:**

### **System Health Cards - Data Mapping Issue**
- **Expected**: Should show "healthy" status based on API data
- **Actual**: Showing "unhealthy" and "0" values
- **Root Cause**: React components not properly extracting data from API responses

### **Key Metrics Cards - Data Extraction Issue**  
- **Expected**: Should show 23 events/min, 290 total events, 0% error rate
- **Actual**: Showing "0" for all values
- **Root Cause**: Data mapping logic not working correctly

## 🔧 **Technical Analysis:**

### **API Data Confirmed Working:**
```json
{
  "websocket-ingestion": {
    "events_per_minute": 23,
    "total_events_received": 290,
    "connection_attempts": 1,
    "error_rate": 0.0
  }
}
```

### **React Component Issue:**
The `OverviewTab.tsx` component was updated with correct data mapping logic, but the changes aren't taking effect. Possible causes:

1. **Build Issue**: Changes not properly compiled
2. **Data Flow Issue**: React hooks not receiving data correctly  
3. **Type Mismatch**: Expected vs actual data structure mismatch

## 🎯 **Next Steps Required:**

1. **Debug React Data Flow**: Check if `useStatistics` hook is receiving data
2. **Verify Component State**: Ensure React components are getting updated props
3. **Check TypeScript Types**: Verify data structure matches expected types
4. **Test Data Mapping**: Confirm the extracted metrics are being passed to components

## 📊 **Current Status:**
- **Backend**: ✅ Fully operational (23 events/min, 290 total events)
- **APIs**: ✅ All endpoints working correctly  
- **Frontend Structure**: ✅ All components rendering
- **Data Display**: ❌ Wrong values shown (needs React debugging)

**The system is working perfectly - this is purely a frontend data mapping issue.**
