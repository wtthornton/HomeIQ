## 🔍 Key Code Changes

### Enhanced daily_analysis.py

**Before (Epic AI-1 only):**
```python
async def run_daily_analysis(self):
    # Phase 1: Fetch events
    # Phase 2: Pattern detection
    # Phase 3: Store patterns
    # Phase 4: Generate suggestions
    # Phase 5: Publish notification
```

**After (Unified AI-1 + AI-2):**
```python
async def run_daily_analysis(self):
    # Phase 1: Device Capability Update (NEW - AI-2)
    capability_stats = await update_device_capabilities_batch(...)
    
    # Phase 2: Fetch Events (SHARED)
    events_df = await data_client.fetch_events(...)
    
    # Phase 3: Pattern Detection (AI-1)
    patterns = detect_patterns(events_df)
    
    # Phase 4: Feature Analysis (NEW - AI-2)
    opportunities = await feature_analyzer.analyze_all_devices()
    
    # Phase 5: Combined Suggestions (AI-1 + AI-2)
    pattern_suggestions = generate_pattern_suggestions(patterns)
    feature_suggestions = generate_feature_suggestions(opportunities)
    all_suggestions = combine_and_rank(pattern_suggestions, feature_suggestions)
    
    # Phase 6: Publish (ENHANCED)
    publish_unified_notification(...)
```

## 📊 Architecture Improvements

### Resource Usage Comparison

| Metric | Before (Real-time) | After (Batch) | Improvement |
|--------|-------------------|--------------|-------------|
| **Uptime** | 730 hrs/month | 2.5 hrs/month | **291x less** |
| **MQTT Connection** | 24/7 | 5-10 min/day | **99% less** |
| **Services** | 2 (listener + scheduler) | 1 (scheduler) | **50% less** |
| **InfluxDB Queries** | Separate | Shared | **More efficient** |
| **Complexity** | High (reconnects, monitoring) | Low (simple cron) | **Simpler** |
| **User Experience** | Suggestions at 7 AM | Suggestions at 7 AM | **Identical** |

### Data Flow Comparison

**Before (Separate):**
```
MQTT Listener (24/7) → device_capabilities DB
Daily Scheduler (3 AM) → Pattern Detection → Suggestions
```

**After (Unified):**
```
Daily Scheduler (3 AM) → [Device Capabilities + Pattern Detection + Feature Analysis] → Combined Suggestions
```

scheduler = DailyAnalysisScheduler()
asyncio.run(scheduler.run_daily_analysis())
"

# Option B: Check service health
docker-compose up ai-automation-service
# Then check: http://localhost:8018/health
```

### 3. Monitor First Run

# ✅ Phase 1/6: Device Capability Update
# ✅ Phase 2/6: Fetching events
# ✅ Phase 3/6: Pattern Detection
# ✅ Phase 4/6: Feature Analysis
# ✅ Phase 5/6: Combined Suggestions
# ✅ Phase 6/6: Publishing notification

from src.database.models import get_db_session
from src.database.crud import get_all_suggestions
import asyncio

async def check():
    async with get_db_session() as db:
        suggestions = await get_all_suggestions(db)
        for s in suggestions:
            print(f'{s.type}: {s.title}')

asyncio.run(check())
"
```
