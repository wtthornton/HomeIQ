# Epic AI-5: Incremental Pattern Processing - Complete Plan

**Created:** 2025-01-15  
**Status:** Ready for Implementation  
**Epic ID:** Epic-AI-5

---

## Executive Summary

### Problem
The AI Automation Service currently processes **30 days of data (3M events) every single day**, reprocessing the same 29 days repeatedly. This results in:
- 30x redundant processing
- 2-4 minute daily processing time
- High memory usage (200-400MB)
- Poor scalability

### Solution
Convert to **incremental processing with multi-layer aggregation storage**:
- Process only **24 hours of new data daily** (100K events)
- Store daily aggregates in InfluxDB
- Query aggregates for historical analysis
- **30x performance improvement**

### Business Value
- **Performance**: 4x faster (4 min → 1 min)
- **Storage**: 80% reduction
- **Scalability**: Linear growth
- **Reliability**: Lower resource usage
- **Cost**: Reduced infrastructure needs

## Architecture Overview

### Current Architecture (Inefficient)
```
Daily Batch (3 AM):
├── Fetch 30 days raw events (3M events)
├── Process all detectors (2-4 min)
├── Store pattern summaries to SQLite
└── Discard all processed data ❌
    └── Next day: Repeat for same 29 days + 1 new ❌
```

### Proposed Architecture (Optimized)
```
Multi-Layer Storage:
├── Layer 1: Raw Events (InfluxDB, 7d, 700K events)
├── Layer 2: Daily Aggregates (InfluxDB, 90d, 900 records)
├── Layer 3: Weekly Aggregates (InfluxDB, 52w, 520 records)
└── Layer 4: Pattern Summaries (SQLite, forever, ~1K records)

Daily Batch (3 AM):
├── Fetch ONLY last 24h (100K events) ✅
├── Process Group A detectors (30 sec) ✅
├── Store daily aggregates to Layer 2 ✅
└── Query aggregates for historical analysis ✅

Weekly Batch (Sunday 3 AM):
├── Query Layer 2 (7 days aggregates)
├── Process Group B detectors (3 min)
└── Store weekly aggregates to Layer 3

Monthly Batch (1st 3 AM):
├── Query Layer 2/3 (aggregates)
├── Process Group C detectors (8 min)
└── Store monthly aggregates to Layer 3
```

## Key Design Decisions

### Why Multi-Layer Storage?
- **Layer 1 (Raw)**: Source of truth for recent data
- **Layer 2 (Daily)**: Pre-computed daily patterns
- **Layer 3 (Weekly/Monthly)**: Long-term trends
- **Layer 4 (Summaries)**: UI/API compatibility

### Why 7 Days Raw Retention?
- Sufficient for daily processing
- Allows reprocessing if needed
- Reduces storage by 77%
- Balances safety vs efficiency

### Why InfluxDB for Aggregates?
- Already in use
- Optimized for time-series data
- Built-in retention policies
- Efficient query performance

### Why Keep SQLite?
- Backward compatibility
- Simple pattern catalog
- No migration needed for UI
- Proven reliability

## Single-Home Optimizations

### Design Principles
1. **Simplicity over Scalability**: Optimize for 1 home, not 1000
2. **Resource Efficiency**: Minimize CPU, memory, storage
3. **Local-First**: No cloud dependencies
4. **Graceful Degradation**: Work even if components fail
5. **Easy Recovery**: Simple backup/restore

### Resource Constraints
- **CPU**: Raspberry Pi 4 typical (4 cores)
- **Memory**: 2-8GB RAM typical
- **Storage**: 32-128GB typical
- **Network**: Local network only
- **Power**: Must handle outages gracefully
