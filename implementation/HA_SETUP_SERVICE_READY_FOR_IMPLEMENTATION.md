## Context7 Validation Summary

### ‚úÖ FastAPI (Trust Score: 9.9/10)
- **Library**: `/fastapi/fastapi`
- **Patterns Validated**:
  - Lifespan context managers for service initialization
  - Async dependency injection with proper exception handling
  - Response model validation with Pydantic

### ‚úÖ React (Trust Score: 9/10)
- **Library**: `/websites/react_dev`
- **Patterns Validated**:
  - useState for component state management
  - useEffect for real-time monitoring (30s polling)
  - Context API for global health status

### ‚úÖ SQLAlchemy 2.0 (Trust Score: 7.5/10)
- **Library**: `/websites/sqlalchemy_en_20`
- **Patterns Validated**:
  - async_sessionmaker for async database access
  - Context managers for proper session lifecycle
  - Async ORM operations with proper transaction management

## Key Architecture Decisions

### 1. New Microservice: `ha-setup-service`
- **Port**: 8010
- **Framework**: FastAPI with lifespan context managers
- **Purpose**: Health monitoring, setup wizards, performance optimization
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Validated with Context7

### 2. Hybrid Database Strategy
- **InfluxDB**: Time-series health metrics and performance data
- **SQLite**: Metadata (devices, integrations, wizard sessions)
- **Rationale**: Follows existing HA Ingestor architecture (Epic 22)
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Validated

### 3. Frontend Integration
- **Location**: New tab in `health-dashboard` (Port 3000)
- **Components**: EnvironmentHealthCard, SetupWizardPanel, PerformanceCard
- **State Management**: React Context API
- **Updates**: 30-second polling with useEffect
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Validated

### 4. Real-Time Monitoring
- **Approach**: Polling every 30 seconds (can upgrade to WebSocket later)
- **Benefits**: Simpler implementation, easier debugging
- **Upgrade Path**: WebSocket available if needed
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Validated

## Risk Assessment

### ‚úÖ Low Risk Items (Context7 Validated)
- FastAPI lifespan context managers (well-documented)
- React useState/useEffect hooks (standard pattern)
- SQLAlchemy async sessions (type-checked)
- Hybrid database strategy (proven in Epic 22)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Medium Risk Items (Mitigated)
- User adoption of automated setups
  - **Mitigation**: Opt-in automation with clear explanations
- Performance impact on HA systems
  - **Mitigation**: Lightweight checks with configurable intervals
- False positive health checks
  - **Mitigation**: Multiple validation methods and user feedback

## Next Steps for Implementation

### Immediate Actions (Dev Agent)
