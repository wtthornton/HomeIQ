2. **Layer 2:** Daily Aggregates (90 days retention, ~9K records)
3. **Layer 3:** Weekly/Monthly Aggregates (52 weeks retention, ~1K records)
4. **Layer 4:** Pattern Summaries (SQLite, forever, ~1K records)

**Measurements Designed:**
- `time_based_daily` - TimeOfDayPatternDetector
- `co_occurrence_daily` - CoOccurrencePatternDetector

**Status:** All 10 detector schemas complete with tags, fields, and examples.

#### ✅ Current Implementation Analysis

**Scheduler Location:**
- `services/ai-automation-service/src/scheduler/daily_analysis.py`
- Runs at 3 AM daily via APScheduler
- Currently processes 30 days of data (3M events)

**Current Flow:**
```python
# Current implementation:
1. Fetch 30 days of raw events from InfluxDB
2. Process all 10 detectors on 3M events
3. Store pattern summaries to SQLite
4. Discard all processed data
5. Next day: Repeat same 29 days + 1 new day ❌
```

**Pattern Detectors Located:**

✅ All 10 detectors exist in codebase:
- `services/ai-automation-service/src/pattern_detection/time_of_day.py`
- `services/ai-automation-service/src/pattern_detection/co_occurrence.py`
- `services/ai-automation-service/src/pattern_detection/sequence_detector.py`
- `services/ai-automation-service/src/pattern_detection/room_based_detector.py`

- `services/ai-automation-service/src/pattern_detection/anomaly_detector.py`
- `services/ai-automation-service/src/pattern_detection/session_detector.py`
- `services/ai-automation-service/src/pattern_detection/day_type_detector.py`
- `services/ai-automation-service/src/pattern_detection/contextual_detector.py`

## Immediate Next Steps

### Phase 1: Kickoff (Day 1)
1. **Review Session** (1-2 hours)
   - Review Epic AI-5 with team
   - Confirm understanding of architecture
   - Address any questions
   - Get final approval to proceed

2. **Environment Setup** (2 hours)
   - Set up development branch
   - Create InfluxDB test buckets
   - Configure retention policies
   - Set up monitoring

### Phase 2: Story AI5.1 (Day 1-2)
**Goal:** Complete multi-layer storage design implementation

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Create InfluxDB buckets:
  - `pattern_aggregates_daily` (90-day retention)
  - `pattern_aggregates_weekly` (52-week retention)
- [ ] Document bucket creation in `docs/deployment/`
- [ ] Create architecture diagram
- [ ] Review with team

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] Retention policies configured
- [ ] Schema documentation updated
- [ ] Team review complete

### Phase 3: Story AI5.2 (Day 2-4)
**Goal:** Implement InfluxDB client for aggregates

**File to Create:** `services/ai-automation-service/src/clients/pattern_aggregate_client.py`

**Key Features:**
```python
class PatternAggregateClient:
    # Group A detectors (daily)
    def write_time_based_daily(...)
    def write_co_occurrence_daily(...)
    def write_sequence_daily(...)
    def write_room_based_daily(...)
    def write_duration_daily(...)
    def write_anomaly_daily(...)
    
    # Query methods
    def query_daily_aggregates_by_date_range(...)
    def query_daily_aggregates_by_entity(...)
    
    # Batch operations
    def write_batch(...)
```

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] Client class implemented
- [ ] Pydantic models created
- [ ] Unit tests passing (>80% coverage)
- [ ] Integration tests with test InfluxDB

### Phase 4: Story AI5.3 (Day 4-8)
**Goal:** Convert 6 detectors to incremental processing

**Conversion Pattern:**
1. Update constructor to accept `PatternAggregateClient`
2. Modify `detect_patterns()` to process 24h data only
3. Add aggregate write calls after detection
4. Update tests

**Example Conversion:**
```python
# Before (current):
def detect_patterns(self, events_df):
    # Process 30 days of data
    patterns = self._analyze_patterns(events_df)
    return patterns

# After (AI5):
def detect_patterns(self, events_df, aggregate_client):
    # Process 24h of data
    patterns = self._analyze_patterns(events_df)
    
    # Store daily aggregates
    for pattern in patterns:
        aggregate_client.write_time_based_daily(
            date=pattern['date'],
            entity_id=pattern['entity_id'],
            hourly_distribution=pattern['hourly_distribution'],
            ...
        )
    
    return patterns
```
