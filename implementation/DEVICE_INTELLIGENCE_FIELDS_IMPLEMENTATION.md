# Device Intelligence Fields Implementation

**Date:** January 2025  
**Service:** device-intelligence-service  
**Issue:** Manufacturer, model, integration fields showing as "Unknown" in database

---

## Implementation Summary

Successfully implemented fixes for device intelligence field population as specified in the plan. All changes have been applied without linter errors.

## Changes Made

### 1. Debug Logging Added (`ha_client.py`)
- **File:** `services/device-intelligence-service/src/clients/ha_client.py`
- **Change:** Added debug logging at line 290 to verify what Home Assistant actually returns for manufacturer and integration fields
- **Impact:** Will help diagnose why fields are showing as "Unknown" by logging actual values from HA API

### 2. Device Class Extraction (`device_parser.py`)
- **File:** `services/device-intelligence-service/src/core/device_parser.py`
- **Changes:**
  - Added `device_class` field to `UnifiedDevice` dataclass (line 31)
  - Added `_extract_device_class()` method (lines 264-274) to extract device class from entity domains
  - Added `_extract_device_class_from_zigbee()` method (lines 276-304) to extract device class from Zigbee capabilities
  - Updated `_parse_ha_device()` to extract and store device_class (line 128)
  - Updated `_parse_zigbee_device()` to extract and store device_class (line 165)
- **Impact:** Devices will now have their type classified (light, sensor, switch, etc.)

### 3. Database Schema Enhanced (`database.py`)
- **File:** `services/device-intelligence-service/src/models/database.py`
- **Changes:** Added new fields after line 36:
  - `device_class` (String, indexed) - Device type classification
  - `config_entry_id` (String, indexed) - HA config entry ID
  - `connections_json` (Text) - Device connections as JSON
  - `identifiers_json` (Text) - Device identifiers as JSON
  - `zigbee_ieee` (String, indexed) - IEEE address for Zigbee devices
  - `is_battery_powered` (Boolean) - Power source indicator
- **Impact:** Database schema now supports richer device metadata

### 4. Database Recreation Function (`database.py`)
- **File:** `services/device-intelligence-service/src/core/database.py`
- **Change:** Added `recreate_tables()` function (lines 76-92)
- **Usage:** Call this function to drop and recreate tables with new schema
- **Impact:** Enables schema updates without manual migration scripts

### 5. Storage Logic Fixed (`discovery_service.py`)
- **File:** `services/device-intelligence-service/src/core/discovery_service.py`
- **Changes:**
  - Added json import at top (line 8)
  - Fixed `area_name` storage (line 259) - now included in device_data
  - Fixed integration storage logic (line 260) - uses proper null check instead of `or`
  - Added `device_class` to device_data (line 261)
  - Added `is_battery_powered` calculation (line 269)
  - Added extraction of config_entry_id, connections_json, identifiers_json from HA device (lines 277-282)
- **Impact:** All fields now properly stored in database

## Testing Verification

To verify the changes work correctly:

1. **Check HA API Response:**
   ```python
   # Enable debug logging to see what HA returns
   # Device {name}: manufacturer={manufacturer}, integration={integration}
   ```

2. **Test Storage:**
   ```python
   # After running discovery, query database
   SELECT name, manufacturer, model, integration, area_name, device_class 
   FROM devices;
   ```

3. **Recreate Tables:**
   ```python
   from services.device_intelligence.src.core.database import recreate_tables
   await recreate_tables()  # Drops and recreates all tables
   ```

## Expected Results

After running discovery with these changes:

- ✅ `manufacturer` = actual manufacturer (e.g., "Signify Netherlands B.V.") or "Unknown" if not in HA
- ✅ `model` = actual model number or "Unknown" if not in HA
- ✅ `integration` = correct integration name (e.g., "hue") or "unknown" if not in HA
- ✅ `area_name` = correct area name (e.g., "office") or NULL if not set
- ✅ `device_class` = device type (e.g., "light", "sensor")
- ✅ `is_battery_powered` = true/false based on power source
- ✅ `config_entry_id` = HA config entry ID
- ✅ `connections_json` = Physical connections (MAC, IP, etc.) as JSON
- ✅ `identifiers_json` = Device identifiers as JSON

## Files Modified

1. `services/device-intelligence-service/src/clients/ha_client.py` - Debug logging
2. `services/device-intelligence-service/src/core/device_parser.py` - Device class extraction
3. `services/device-intelligence-service/src/core/discovery_service.py` - Storage fixes
4. `services/device-intelligence-service/src/models/database.py` - Schema enhancements
5. `services/device-intelligence-service/src/core/database.py` - Recreate tables function

## Next Steps

1. Recreate database tables using `recreate_tables()` function
2. Run the discovery service to populate devices with new fields
3. Verify database contains correct manufacturer, model, integration, and area_name values
4. Check debug logs to see what HA actually returns for devices showing "Unknown"

## Notes

- The analysis document indicates that HA returns `manufacturer: None` for most devices, which explains the "Unknown" values
- Some devices (like "Sun") simply don't have manufacturer data in HA's device registry
- The fixes ensure that when data IS available from HA, it will be properly stored
- The debug logging will help diagnose whether the issue is with HA data or our storage logic
