## üìù Notes

- Context tracking is implemented but needs backend API support for conversation_history parameter
- The backend already accepts optional `context` and `conversation_history` parameters in AskAIQueryRequest
- Follow-up prompt generation will require backend logic changes
- Context indicator is a pure UI component with no backend dependencies
