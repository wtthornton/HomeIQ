## Critical Issues (Action Required)

### 1. Weather API - Missing InfluxDB Bucket ‚ùå BLOCKING

**Service:** `homeiq-weather-api`  
**Severity:** ERROR  
**Impact:** Weather data cannot be stored

**Error:**
```
Error writing to InfluxDB: (404) Not Found
message: "bucket \"weather_data\" not found"
```

**Details:**
- Weather API is attempting to write to `weather_data` bucket
- InfluxDB only has `home_assistant_events` bucket
- Service is running but data writes are failing

**Solution Required:**
```bash
# Create missing weather_data bucket in InfluxDB
docker exec homeiq-influxdb influx bucket create \
  -n weather_data \
  -o homeiq \
  -r 0
```

**Files to Check:**
- `services/weather-api/src/main.py` (line 191)
- `infrastructure/influxdb/init-influxdb.sh` (may need to add bucket creation)

---

## Warnings (Configuration Issues)

### 2. Setup Service - Admin API Integration Failed ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Service:** `homeiq-setup-service`  
**Severity:** WARNING (recurring every 5 minutes)  
**Impact:** Integration health check showing 2/6 integrations healthy

**Message:**
```
WARNING: Integration Issues Detected
Integrations with errors: Admin API
Integration check complete - 2/6 healthy
```

**Details:**
- Setup service cannot connect to Admin API
- Health checks running but showing persistent failures
- Service operational but integration monitoring degraded

**Investigation Needed:**
- Check Admin API endpoint availability from setup service
- Review network connectivity between services
- Verify Admin API health endpoint: `http://homeiq-admin:8004/health`

### 3. Smart Meter Service - Using Mock Data ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Service:** `homeiq-smart-meter`  
**Severity:** WARNING  
**Impact:** Real smart meter data unavailable

**Message:**
```
HOME_ASSISTANT_URL and HOME_ASSISTANT_TOKEN not configured - using mock data
```

**Details:**
- Service running with mock/test data
- Not connected to actual smart meter via Home Assistant
- This may be intentional if no smart meter is configured

**Solution (if needed):**
Add to `infrastructure/env.production` or service environment:
```bash
HOME_ASSISTANT_URL=http://192.168.1.86:8123
HOME_ASSISTANT_TOKEN=<long-lived-access-token>
```

```
No WattTime credentials configured! Service will run in standby mode.
Add WATTTIME_USERNAME/PASSWORD to environment to enable data fetching.
```

**Details:**
- Service running in standby mode
- No real carbon intensity data being fetched
- This may be intentional if WattTime API access not available

**Solution (if needed):**
Add to service environment:
```bash
WATTTIME_USERNAME=<username>
WATTTIME_PASSWORD=<password>
```

---

### 5. Calendar Service - Calendar Not Found ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Service:** `homeiq-calendar`  
**Severity:** WARNING  
**Impact:** Calendar integration not functional

**Message:**
```
Configured calendar 'calendar.primary' not found in Home Assistant
```

**Details:**
- Service looking for `calendar.primary` entity
- Entity does not exist in Home Assistant
- Check if Home Assistant has calendar integration enabled

**Solution:**
1. Verify calendar integration in Home Assistant
2. Update `CALENDAR_ENTITY_ID` environment variable to correct calendar name
3. Or create `calendar.primary` in Home Assistant

---

### 6. AI Automation Service - Migration Issue (Non-Fatal) ‚ÑπÔ∏è

**Service:** `ai-automation-service`  
**Severity:** INFO (non-blocking)  
**Impact:** Database migration skipped, but service started successfully

**Message:**
```
KeyError: '20251018_add_synergy_opportunities'
Migration skipped
AI Automation Service Starting Up
```

**Details:**
- Alembic migration dependency issue
- Migration was skipped but didn't prevent startup
- Service is running and healthy
- Fresh database may not need this specific migration

**Action:** Monitor for any missing database schema issues

## Informational Findings

### 7. Enrichment Pipeline - Verbose Logging ‚ÑπÔ∏è

**Service:** `homeiq-enrichment`  
**Severity:** INFO  
**Impact:** None (excessive debug logging)

**Details:**
- Service logging many WARNING level messages for normal operations
- Messages like "Validation result", "Calling normalizer.normalize_event"
- These appear to be debug-level logs incorrectly set to WARNING level

**Recommendation:** Review logging levels in `services/enrichment-pipeline/src/main.py`

### 8. InfluxDB - Deprecated Argument ‚ÑπÔ∏è

**Service:** `homeiq-influxdb`  
**Severity:** INFO  
**Impact:** None

**Message:**
```
nats-port argument is deprecated and unused

```

### Missing Buckets

‚ùå `weather_data` - Required by weather-api service

---

## Recommended Actions

### Immediate (High Priority)

1. **Create weather_data bucket in InfluxDB**
   ```bash
   docker exec homeiq-influxdb influx bucket create -n weather_data -o homeiq -r 0
   ```

2. **Investigate Admin API connectivity from setup service**
   - Check network connectivity
   - Verify Admin API is accessible at `http://homeiq-admin:8004`
   - Review firewall/network policies

### Short-term (Medium Priority)

3. **Configure optional services (if needed):**
   - Smart meter integration (add HA credentials)
   - Carbon intensity service (add WattTime credentials)
   - Calendar service (verify calendar entity in HA)

4. **Review logging levels:**
   - Reduce verbose WARNING logs in enrichment pipeline
   - Adjust to appropriate INFO/DEBUG levels

### Long-term (Low Priority)

5. **Monitor AI automation service:**
   - Watch for any schema-related issues
   - May need migration script cleanup

6. **Update InfluxDB initialization:**
   - Add weather_data bucket to init script
   - Ensure buckets are created automatically on fresh deployments

---

## Deployment Metrics

- **Total Services:** 20
- **Healthy Services:** 20 (100%)

---

## Next Steps

1. Create the missing `weather_data` InfluxDB bucket
2. Investigate Admin API integration issue
