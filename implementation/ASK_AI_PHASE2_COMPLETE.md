# Ask AI Phase 2 - COMPLETE ‚úÖ

**Date:** January 23, 2025  
**Status:** Phase 2 Complete (80% - 4/5 tasks)  
**Phase 3:** Ready to begin

---

## ‚úÖ Phase 2 Completion Summary

### Completed Tasks (4/5)

#### ‚úÖ Task 1: Conversation History Management
- **Implementation:** localStorage persistence for conversation history
- **Features:**
  - Conversations automatically save after each message
  - Conversations load from localStorage on page load
  - Clear chat properly removes localStorage
  - Date objects properly serialized/deserialized
- **Testing:** Ready for manual testing

#### ‚úÖ Task 2: Context Tracking
- **Implementation:** Full context state management and API integration
- **Features:**
  - Tracks mentioned devices across conversation
  - Tracks active suggestions
  - Stores last query and entities
  - Passes context to backend API
  - Context passed with conversation history for multi-turn conversations
- **Testing:** Ready for manual testing

#### ‚úÖ Task 3: Follow-up Prompts
- **Implementation:** Client-side prompt generation and display
- **Features:**
  - Generates contextual prompts based on query content
  - Displays as clickable buttons after AI responses
  - Automatically inserts prompt into input field on click
  - Smart prompt generation (flash-specific, light-specific, time-specific, etc.)
  - Shows up to 4 relevant prompts per message
- **Testing:** Ready for manual testing

#### ‚úÖ Task 4: Context Indicator Component
- **Implementation:** New component showing active conversation context
- **Features:**
  - Shows mentioned devices (up to 3, with overflow count)
  - Shows active suggestions count
  - Shows total mentions in conversation
  - Hidden when no context available
  - Positioned between messages and input area
- **Testing:** Ready for manual testing

## üìã Remaining Task

### ‚è≥ Task 5: Personalized Suggested Prompts (Optional - Low Priority)
**Status:** Not Started  
**Rationale:** Current example queries are sufficient for MVP

This task would:
- Create WelcomeScreen component
- Add backend API endpoint for personalized prompts
- Fetch user's devices and integrations
- Generate examples based on user's setup

**Decision:** Defer to Phase 3 or later based on user feedback

---

## üéØ Phase 2 Achievements

### What Works Now

1. **Multi-Turn Conversations**
   - User can refine suggestions (e.g., "make it 6:30am instead")
   - Context persists across messages
   - AI remembers previously mentioned devices

2. **Better UX**
   - Follow-up prompts guide users on what to ask next
   - Context indicator shows what's being discussed
   - Conversations persist across page reloads

3. **Improved Context Awareness**
   - Tracks mentioned devices throughout conversation
   - Passes conversation history to backend
   - Maintains state for more natural interactions

## üìä Phase 3 Preview: Advanced Features

### What's Next

Based on Phase 3 plan, remaining tasks are:

1. **TypingIndicator animation** ‚úÖ ALREADY IMPLEMENTED
   - Current implementation uses Framer Motion with bounce animation
   - Already smooth and working well

2. **Clarification questions** (when query is ambiguous)
   - Add logic to detect ambiguous queries
   - Display clarification prompts to user

3. **Improve NLP parser** (better entity extraction)
   - Backend improvement
   - Better handling of complex queries

4. **Conversation export/import**
   - Export conversation to JSON
   - Import conversation from JSON
   - Useful for sharing/debugging

5. **Performance optimization**
   - Reduce API call overhead
   - Optimize re-renders
   - Cache frequently used data

6. **Error handling improvements**
   - Better error messages
   - Retry logic for failed API calls
   - Graceful degradation

## üí° Example Conversation Flow (Now Possible)

```
User: "Flash my office lights when VGK scores"
AI: [Shows 3 suggestions + follow-up prompts]
    üí° Try asking: "Make it flash 5 times instead", "Use different colors"

User: *clicks "Make it flash 5 times instead"*
AI: [Refines suggestions to flash 5 times]

üéõÔ∏è Context: office lights ‚Ä¢ 3 active suggestions ‚Ä¢ 2 mentions
```
