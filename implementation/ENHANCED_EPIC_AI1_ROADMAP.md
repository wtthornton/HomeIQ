**New Safety Features:**
- 6 safety rule checks (climate extremes, bulk shutoff, security disable, etc.)
- Conflict detection with existing automations
- Safety scoring (0-100)
- Configurable safety levels (strict/moderate/permissive)
- Override mechanism for power users

**Impact:**
- AI1.19 integrates with AI1.11 deployment flow
