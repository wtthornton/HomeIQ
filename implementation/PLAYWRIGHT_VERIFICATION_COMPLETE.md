## ⚠️ Minor Issues (Non-Critical)

### 1. Tab Count Selector Too Broad
**Issue:** Test counted 15 buttons instead of 11  
**Cause:** Selector matched additional buttons (theme toggle, auto-refresh, etc.)  
**Impact:** ⚠️ Low - Does not affect functionality  
**Status:** Test needs refinement, but functionality confirmed via other tests

### 2. Network Idle Timeout
**Issue:** `waitForLoadState('networkidle')` timed out after 30s  
**Cause:** Dashboard has active WebSocket connections  
**Impact:** ⚠️ None - Test timeout issue only  
**Status:** Expected behavior for real-time dashboard
