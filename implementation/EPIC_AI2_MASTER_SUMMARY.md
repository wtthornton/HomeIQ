## 🏗️ Architecture Transformation

### Before: Separate Systems
```
MQTT Listener (24/7) → device_capabilities
  - 730 hrs/month uptime
  - 2 separate services
  - Separate InfluxDB queries

Daily Scheduler (3 AM) → Pattern Detection
  - Epic AI-1 only
  - No feature suggestions
```

### After: Unified Batch
```
Unified Daily Batch (3 AM) → Combined AI Analysis
  - 2.5 hrs/month uptime (291x less!)
  - 1 unified service
  - Shared InfluxDB query

6-Phase Job:
1. Device Capability Update (AI-2)
2. Fetch Events (Shared)
3. Pattern Detection (AI-1)
4. Feature Analysis (AI-2)
5. Combined Suggestions (AI-1 + AI-2)
6. Publish Notification
```

**Result:** Same user experience, 99% less resource usage

**Epic AI-1 (Pattern Automation):**
- Analyzes last 30 days of InfluxDB events
- Detects time-of-day patterns, co-occurrence, anomalies
- Generates automation suggestions
- Example: "Turn on bedroom light at 10:30 PM"

**Epic AI-2 (Device Intelligence):**
- Discovers device capabilities from Zigbee2MQTT
- Analyzes feature utilization
- Suggests unused high-impact features
- Example: "Enable LED notifications on your switch"

**Combined (Story 2.5):**
- Single daily job processes both
- Shared InfluxDB data
- Unified suggestion ranking
- Example: "Turn on light at 6:30 PM AND enable LED notifications"
