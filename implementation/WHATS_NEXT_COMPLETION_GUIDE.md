## üìã BMAD Framework: Remaining Tasks

### Task 1: Manual Frontend Testing (CRITICAL) ‚ö°

**Priority**: CRITICAL  
**Time Estimate**: 15-20 minutes  
**Requires**: Manual browser interaction

#### Test Procedures

##### Step 1: Open Dashboard
```
1. Open browser to http://localhost:3000
2. Verify page loads without errors
3. Check browser console (F12) for JavaScript errors
4. Verify all existing tabs still work
```

**Expected**: Dashboard loads, no errors in console

---

##### Step 2: Navigate to Sports Tab
```
1. Click on Sports tab üèàüèí in navigation
2. Observe what displays
```

**Expected Outcomes**:
- **If no teams selected**: Empty state with "Add Your First Team" button
- **If teams previously selected**: Live/Upcoming games display
- **NO 404 errors in console**
- **NO routing errors**

**Test Result**: [ ] PASS / [ ] FAIL

---

##### Step 3: Test Team Selection Wizard
```
1. Click "Add Your First Team" (if empty state)
   OR click "‚öôÔ∏è Manage Teams" button
2. Verify wizard displays with 3 steps
3. Select NFL team (e.g., Dallas Cowboys)
   - Search works
   - Team card clickable
   - Selection visual feedback
4. Click "Continue to NHL ‚Üí"
5. Select NHL team (e.g., Boston Bruins)
6. Click "Review & Confirm"
7. Verify summary shows selected teams
8. Click "Confirm & Start"
```

**Expected**: 
- Wizard flow smooth and intuitive
- Teams save to localStorage

**Test Result**: [ ] PASS / [ ] FAIL

---

##### Step 4: Verify API Calls Working
```
1. Open Browser DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Network tab
3. Filter by "sports"
4. Observe API calls while on Sports tab
```

**Expected API Calls**:
- `GET /api/sports/teams?league=NFL` ‚Üí 200 OK
- `GET /api/sports/teams?league=NHL` ‚Üí 200 OK
- `GET /api/sports/games/live?team_ids=...` ‚Üí 200 OK

**NO 404 errors**  
**NO 500 errors**

**Test Result**: [ ] PASS / [ ] FAIL

---

##### Step 5: Test Real-Time Updates
```
1. Stay on Sports tab with teams selected
2. Wait 30 seconds (polling interval)
3. Observe network tab for automatic refresh calls
4. Verify no errors during auto-refresh
```

**Expected**: 
- API calls every 30 seconds
- No errors during polling
- UI updates smoothly

**Test Result**: [ ] PASS / [ ] FAIL

3. Verify message is helpful
```

**Expected**: 
- "No teams selected" message
- "Add Your First Team" button visible

**Test Result**: [ ] PASS / [ ] FAIL

---

##### Step 8: Regression Check
```
1. Click through all other dashboard tabs:
   - Overview
   - Services
   - Monitoring
   - Data Sources
   - Dependencies
   - Settings
2. Verify each tab loads correctly

### Task 2: 24-Hour Stability Monitoring

**Priority**: HIGH  
**Time Estimate**: 24 hours (passive)  
**Requires**: Log monitoring

#### Monitoring Checklist

```bash
# Check logs periodically
docker logs homeiq-sports-data --tail 50

# Monitor resource usage
docker stats homeiq-sports-data

# Check API usage
curl http://localhost:8005/api/v1/metrics/api-usage
```

#### What to Watch For
- [ ] No memory leaks (memory should stay <128MB)
- [ ] No error spikes in logs
- [ ] API calls stay under 100/day
- [ ] Cache hit rate stays >80%
- [ ] No service crashes
- [ ] Response times remain <500ms

#### Monitoring Schedule
- **Hour 1**: Check immediately
- **Hour 4**: Check again
- **Hour 8**: Check again
- **Hour 24**: Final check before sign-off

---

### Task 3: Regression Testing (Optional but Recommended)

**Priority**: MEDIUM  
**Time Estimate**: 10 minutes

```bash
# Test admin API still works
curl http://localhost:8003/api/v1/health

# Test WebSocket ingestion
curl http://localhost:8001/health

# Test enrichment pipeline
curl http://localhost:8002/health

# Test InfluxDB
curl http://localhost:8086/health
```

**Expected**: All services return healthy status

---

### Task 4: Fix Health Check (Non-Critical)

**Priority**: LOW  
**Time Estimate**: 10 minutes  
**Can be done later**

The sports-data service shows "unhealthy" in Docker but works perfectly. This is cosmetic only.

#### To Fix (Later):
```yaml
# In docker-compose.yml, update sports-data healthcheck:
healthcheck:
  test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:8005/health"]
  interval: 30s
  timeout: 10s
  retries: 3
  start_period: 10s
```

This requires:
1. Adding `curl` to the sports-data Docker image
2. Or using a different health check method

**Not blocking deployment** - service works perfectly despite false positive.

---

### Task 5: Create Final Completion Report

**Priority**: HIGH  
**Time Estimate**: 10 minutes  
**When**: After frontend testing passes

## üéì BMAD Framework: Quality Standards

### Why These Steps Matter

**Frontend Testing**: 
- Ensures users can actually use the feature
- Catches UI bugs that API tests miss
- Validates real-world workflows

**24-Hour Monitoring**:
- Catches memory leaks
- Validates stability under load
- Ensures no time-based issues

**Regression Testing**:
- Confirms no side effects
- Validates existing features work
- Prevents production incidents

**Documentation**:
- Enables future maintainers
- Provides context for decisions
- Supports troubleshooting

## üöÄ Quick Start: What To Do Right Now

### Copy/paste this command to start:

```bash
# Open the dashboard in your browser
start http://localhost:3000

# Or on Mac/Linux:
# open http://localhost:3000
# xdg-open http://localhost:3000
```

Then follow **Task 1: Manual Frontend Testing** step-by-step above.

---

## üìû Need Help?

### If Frontend Testing Fails
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Check network tab for failed API calls
3. Review nginx logs: `docker logs homeiq-dashboard`
4. Review sports-data logs: `docker logs homeiq-sports-data`
5. Try rollback procedure if critical

### If You Find Bugs
1. Document the bug clearly
2. Include screenshots
3. Note reproduction steps
4. Mark in QA gate
5. Decide: Fix now or defer?

### If You Need to Rollback
See `implementation/DEPLOYMENT_COMPLETE.md` ‚Üí Rollback Procedure
