## 🎯 Key Features Documented

### Two Distinct Data Flow Patterns

#### Pattern A: Continuous Push to InfluxDB
- **Services**: Air Quality, Carbon Intensity, Electricity Pricing, Smart Meter, Calendar
- **Flow**: External API → Service (periodic) → InfluxDB → Admin API → Dashboard
- **Characteristics**: Time-series data, historical trends, continuous operation

#### Pattern B: On-Demand Pull Queries
- **Services**: Sports Data
- **Flow**: Dashboard → Admin API → Service → External API (cache miss) → Response
- **Characteristics**: Transient data, real-time queries, no persistence

## 🔗 Integration Documentation

### Relationship to Core HA System

Documented how external APIs complement the main HA event flow:

**HA Event Flow** (high-volume push):
- 10,000+ events/sec from Home Assistant
- Real-time device state changes
- Documented in HA_EVENT_CALL_TREE.md

**External API Flow** (low-volume pull/push):
- 1-288 fetches/day from external sources
- Contextual enrichment data
- Documented in EXTERNAL_API_CALL_TREES.md

**Combined Value**: Smart automation decisions using both data sources

Example: Thermostat automation considering both HA temperature events and real-time electricity pricing.
