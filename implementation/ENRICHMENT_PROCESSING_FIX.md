# Enrichment Processing Display Fix

## Issue
The Processing card in the Health Dashboard was showing:
- **0 proc/min** (should show ~24 events/min)
- **0 events** (should show ~858 total events)
- Status: Healthy ✅ (this was correct)

## Root Cause Analysis

### Investigation Steps
1. ✅ Verified enrichment service is working correctly
   - Direct health check: `http://localhost:8002/health`
   - Result: 858 normalized events, 858 points written to InfluxDB ✅
   
2. ✅ Checked stats API transformation
   - API endpoint: `/api/v1/stats?period=1h`
   - Result: enrichment-pipeline showed 0 events_per_minute ❌
   
3. ✅ Found the bug in data transformation

### The Bug
In `services/admin-api/src/stats_endpoints.py`, the `_transform_enrichment_stats_to_stats()` function was looking for the wrong data structure:

**Before (INCORRECT):**
```python
# Looking for non-existent structure
quality_metrics = stats_data.get("quality_metrics", {})
if quality_metrics.get("rates", {}).get("events_per_second", 0) > 0:
    metrics["events_per_minute"] = quality_metrics["rates"]["events_per_second"] * 60
```

**Actual API Response:**
```json
{
  "normalization": {
    "normalized_events": 858,
    "normalization_errors": 0,
    "success_rate": 100.0
  },
  "influxdb": {
    "points_written": 858,
    "write_errors": 0
  },
  "uptime": 2012.2281121989945
}
```

## Fix Applied

### File Modified
- **File:** `services/admin-api/src/stats_endpoints.py`
- **Function:** `_transform_enrichment_stats_to_stats()`
- **Lines:** 408-444

### Changes Made
```python
# NEW: Use actual API structure
normalization = stats_data.get("normalization", {})
uptime_seconds = stats_data.get("uptime", 0)
normalized_events = normalization.get("normalized_events", 0)

# Calculate events per minute from uptime and normalized events
if uptime_seconds > 0 and normalized_events > 0:
    uptime_minutes = uptime_seconds / 60
    metrics["events_per_minute"] = round(normalized_events / uptime_minutes, 2)

# Total events = normalized events
metrics["total_events_received"] = normalized_events

# Connection attempts = points written to InfluxDB
metrics["connection_attempts"] = influxdb_stats.get("points_written", 0)
```

## Results

### Before Fix
```json
{
  "events_per_minute": 0,           // ❌ Wrong
  "total_events_received": 0,       // ❌ Wrong
  "connection_attempts": 0          // ❌ Wrong
}
```

### After Fix
```json
{
  "events_per_minute": 24.53,       // ✅ Correct
  "total_events_received": 858,     // ✅ Correct
  "connection_attempts": 858        // ✅ Correct
}
```

## Verification

### API Testing
```bash
# Before fix
curl http://localhost:8003/api/v1/stats?period=1h
# enrichment-pipeline: {"events_per_minute": 0, "total_events_received": 0}

# After fix
curl http://localhost:8003/api/v1/stats?period=1h
# enrichment-pipeline: {"events_per_minute": 24.53, "total_events_received": 858}
```

### UI Testing
- ✅ Processing card now shows "24.53 proc/min"
- ✅ Total Processed shows "858 events"
- ✅ Status remains "Healthy"
- ✅ Data updates every 30 seconds

## Technical Details

### Calculation Method
```python
# Events per minute = Total events / Uptime in minutes
uptime_minutes = uptime_seconds / 60  # 2012.23 / 60 = 33.54 minutes
events_per_minute = normalized_events / uptime_minutes  # 858 / 33.54 = 24.53
```

### Data Flow
```
Enrichment Service → /api/v1/stats → Admin API → Transformation → Dashboard
    858 events          858 events      0 events        24.53/min      24.53/min
     (working)          (working)      (wrong)          (fixed)        (displayed)
```

## Impact

### Before
- ❌ Processing card showed 0 activity
- ❌ Misleading - looked like service wasn't working
- ❌ Couldn't monitor enrichment pipeline performance

### After
- ✅ Processing card shows real activity (24.53 proc/min)
- ✅ Accurate monitoring of enrichment pipeline
- ✅ Total events match actual processing (858 events)
- ✅ Consistent with ingestion metrics (25.54 evt/min)

## Related Issues Fixed

This was the same pattern as the original "events per minute" issue:
1. ✅ **Ingestion**: Fixed endpoint URL (`/api/statistics` → `/api/v1/stats`)
2. ✅ **Processing**: Fixed data transformation (wrong structure → correct structure)

Both issues were **UI-only problems** - the backend services were working correctly.

## Files Changed

### Backend
- `services/admin-api/src/stats_endpoints.py` - Fixed transformation function

### Deployment
- Rebuilt and deployed admin-api container
- No frontend changes needed (HTTP polling already working)

## Performance

- **Fix Time:** ~5 minutes
- **Deployment:** ~2 minutes
- **Lines Changed:** ~20 lines
- **Impact:** High (now shows accurate metrics)

## Next Steps

1. ✅ **Verify UI displays correctly** - Processing card shows 24.53 proc/min
2. ✅ **Monitor for accuracy** - Data should update every 30s
3. ✅ **Confirm consistency** - Ingestion (~25/min) vs Processing (~24/min) should be similar

## Summary

**Root Cause:** Data transformation function looking for wrong API structure  
**Solution:** Updated transformation to use actual enrichment service API structure  
**Result:** Processing card now displays accurate metrics (24.53 proc/min, 858 total events)

**Status:** ✅ **FIXED & DEPLOYED**
