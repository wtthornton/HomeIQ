## ⏳ What's Next (BMAD Framework)

### 🎯 NEXT ACTION: Frontend Testing (15-20 minutes)

**You need to manually test the dashboard UI.**

#### Quick Start:
```bash
# 1. Open browser to dashboard
start http://localhost:3000

# 2. Follow the testing guide
# See: implementation/WHATS_NEXT_COMPLETION_GUIDE.md
```

#### What to Test:
1. **Sports tab loads** (no errors)
2. **Team selection wizard works**
3. **NHL teams display**
4. **NFL teams display** 
5. **No 404 errors in console**
6. **Real-time updates work** (30s polling)
7. **Team management works**
8. **Other tabs still work** (regression check)

**Expected Time**: 15-20 minutes  
**Blocking**: YES - Need this before marking feature complete

---

### 📊 Then: 24-Hour Monitoring (Passive)

```bash
# Check logs periodically
docker logs ha-ingestor-sports-data --tail 50

# Check resource usage
docker stats ha-ingestor-sports-data
```

**What to Watch**:
- Memory stays <128MB
- No error spikes
- API calls <100/day
- No crashes

**Expected Time**: 24 hours (mostly passive)  
**Blocking**: YES - For final sign-off

---

### 📝 Finally: Completion Report (5 minutes)

After tests pass:
1. Update QA gate with results
2. Create final completion report
3. Mark feature as COMPLETE ✅

---

## 🚦 Decision Points

### Can I use this NOW?
**YES!** ✅ The fix is deployed and API endpoints work.

### Is the feature COMPLETE?
**Almost!** Need to verify frontend works for users (you haven't tested the UI yet).

### When can I mark it DONE?
**After**: Frontend testing ✅ + 24hr monitoring ✅ + Final report ✅

```

**Time**: 5 min every 4-8 hours  
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Blocking**: For final sign-off

### Task 3: Create Report (AFTER TESTING)
- Fill out completion report template
- Update Epic 11 status
- Mark feature as COMPLETE

**Time**: 5-10 minutes  
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Blocking**: For official completion

## 🎓 BMAD Framework: Why These Steps?

### Why Frontend Testing?
- API tests confirm backend works
- But users interact with UI, not APIs
- Could be UI bugs we haven't caught
- 5-10 min now saves hours of support later

### Why 24-Hour Monitoring?
- Catches memory leaks
- Validates stability
- Ensures no time-based bugs
- Professional deployment practice

### Why Final Report?
- Documents what was done
- Provides sign-off record
- Helps future maintainers
- Completes BMAD framework process

## ⚡ Quick Reference

### Open Dashboard
```bash
start http://localhost:3000
# or: open http://localhost:3000 (Mac)
# or: xdg-open http://localhost:3000 (Linux)
```

### Check Logs
```bash
docker logs ha-ingestor-sports-data --tail 50
```

### Check Health
```bash
curl http://localhost:8005/health
curl http://localhost:3000/api/sports/teams?league=NHL
```

### Get Help
```bash
# See detailed guide
cat implementation/WHATS_NEXT_COMPLETION_GUIDE.md

# See QA gate
cat docs/qa/gates/11.x-sports-architecture-simplification.yml

# Rollback if needed
# See: implementation/DEPLOYMENT_COMPLETE.md
```

## 🎯 Bottom Line

**You're 5/6 done!** Just need to:

1. ⏳ **Test the UI** (15 min) ← **START HERE**
2. ⏳ **Monitor for 24hrs** (passive)
3. ⏳ **Create report** (5 min)

Then you can mark it **COMPLETE** ✅ and move on!

## 📞 Questions?

- **"The API works, why test the UI?"**  
  → Because users use the UI, not the API. We need to ensure the full experience works.

- **"Can I skip the 24-hour monitoring?"**  
  → You could, but it's professional best practice. Just check logs 2-3 times.

- **"What if I find bugs during testing?"**  
  → Document them, decide if critical (fix now) or minor (defer), update QA gate.

- **"When is it truly 'done'?"**  
  → When QA gate shows all critical tests passed and you've signed off.

---

**Next Action**: Open the completion guide and start frontend testing!

**File to Read**: `implementation/WHATS_NEXT_COMPLETION_GUIDE.md`

**Time Needed**: ~24 hours total (20 minutes active work)
