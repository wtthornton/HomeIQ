## Rollback Plan (If Needed)

If issues are discovered:

```bash
# Option 1: Restart services
docker-compose restart health-dashboard ai-automation-ui ai-automation-service

# Option 2: Rebuild from previous version
git checkout HEAD~1 services/
docker-compose build health-dashboard ai-automation-ui ai-automation-service
docker-compose up -d

# Option 3: Stop problematic services
docker-compose stop ai-automation-ui
# Users can still access features via health-dashboard:3000
```

---

## Monitoring

### Check Service Logs
```bash
# Health Dashboard
docker logs homeiq-dashboard --tail 50 -f

# AI Automation UI
docker logs ai-automation-ui --tail 50 -f

# AI Automation Service
docker logs ai-automation-service --tail 50 -f
```

### Check Service Health
```bash
# All services
docker-compose ps

# Specific services
docker-compose ps health-dashboard ai-automation-ui ai-automation-service
```

### Check API Connectivity
```bash
# Health checks
curl http://localhost:3000
curl http://localhost:3001/health
curl http://localhost:8018/health

# API test
curl http://localhost:3001/api/suggestions/list
```

---

## Known Limitations

1. **React SPA**: AI Automations button won't appear in `curl` HTML output (it's rendered by JavaScript)
2. **Development Mode**: To run in dev mode, use `docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up`
3. **CORS**: Only configured for localhost and container networks (add production domains if deploying externally)
