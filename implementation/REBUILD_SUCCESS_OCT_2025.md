## ⚠️ Optional Services - Configuration Needed

The following services need API keys to function:

### Air Quality Service
**Required:** `AIRNOW_API_KEY`
```bash
# Get API key from: https://www.airnow.gov/international/us-embassies-and-consulates/
# Add to .env:
AIRNOW_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# Restart service:
docker-compose restart air-quality
```

### Calendar Service
**Required:** Google OAuth credentials
```bash
# Set up OAuth: https://console.cloud.google.com/
# Add to .env:
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
GOOGLE_REFRESH_TOKEN=your_refresh_token

# Restart service:
docker-compose restart calendar
```

### Carbon Intensity Service
**Required:** `WATTTIME_API_TOKEN`
```bash
# Get API token from: https://www.watttime.org/
# Add to .env:
WATTTIME_API_TOKEN=your_token_here

# Restart service:
docker-compose restart carbon-intensity
```

**Note:** These services are optional - the core system works perfectly without them!

## 🆘 Optional Service Status

### Services Not Critical (Restarting)
These services need API keys but aren't critical for core functionality:

1. **air-quality** - Restarting (needs AIRNOW_API_KEY)
2. **calendar** - Restarting (needs Google OAuth)
3. **carbon-intensity** - Restarting (needs WATTTIME_API_TOKEN)

**Action:** Configure API keys in `.env` and restart if you want these features.

**Status:** ℹ️ Optional - system works fine without them
