  "description": "Time-based office and living room lighting routine centered around the Office WLED, with a cleanup step that turns off all lights not used in the chosen time slot. This uses your clarified device choice of **Office WLED** as the key light and dims/brightens it based on time, while also controlling **Living Room** during the evening window.",
  "trigger_summary": "Triggered at a chosen event (e.g., a helper toggle, a button, or a motion event) and then checks the current time:\n- Between 06:00 and 09:00\n- Between 17:00 and 20:00\n- After 21:00",
  "action_summary": "In plain language, the automation would:\n1. Check current time.\n2. If time is between 06:00 and 09:00:\n   - Turn on **Office** (Office WLED) at 50% brightness with a warm white tone (e.g., rgb_color around [255, 200, 150]).\n3. Else if time is between 17:00 and 20:00:\n   - Turn on **Living Room** at ~80% brightness with a neutral/cooler white (e.g., [200, 220, 255]).\n   - Turn on **Office** at 100% brightness with a cool white tone (e.g., [200, 220, 255]).\n4. Else if time is after 21:00:\n   - Turn on **Office** at 20% brightness with a very warm, low-intensity white (e.g., [255, 160, 100]) for a night-light feel.\n5. Wait 5 seconds.\n6. Turn off **all other lights** that do not match the time-based selection. Because your clarification explicitly selected **Office Wled** as the focus, the cleanup step would:\n   - After the morning or late-night Office-only scenes: turn **Living Room** off.\n   - After the evening scene (Office + Living Room): turn off any other office bulbs if they were on (e.g., **Office Back Left**, **Office Front Left**, **Office Front Right**, **Office Back Right**), keeping **Office** and **Living Room** on.\n\nImplementation outline (Home Assistant script-style YAML for the core logic):\n\n```yaml\nalias: Time-based Office WLED and Living Room\nmode: single\ntrigger:\n  - platform: event\n    event_type: my_custom_time_lighting_trigger  # replace with your real trigger (e.g. motion, button)\ncondition: []\naction:\n  - variables:\n      now_time: \"{{ now().strftime('%H:%M') }}\"\n  - choose:\n      # 06:00\u201309:00 \u2192 Office WLED 50% warm, others off after cleanup\n      - conditions:\n          - condition: time\n            after: \"06:00:00\"\n            before: \"09:00:00\"\n        sequence:\n          - service: light.turn_on\n            target:\n              entity_id: light.wled\n            data:\n              brightness_pct: 50\n              rgb_color: [255, 200, 150]\n          - delay: \"00:00:05\"\n          - service: light.turn_off\n            target:\n              entity_id:\n                - light.living_room_2\n                - light.hue_office_back_left\n                - light.hue_color_downlight_1_6\n                - light.hue_color_downlight_1_7\n                - light.hue_color_downlight_2_2\n\n      # 17:00\u201320:00 \u2192 Living Room 80% + Office WLED 100% cool, cleanup other office bulbs\n      - conditions:\n          - condition: time\n            after: \"17:00:00\"\n            before: \"20:00:00\"\n        sequence:\n          - service: light.turn_on\n            target:\n              entity_id: light.living_room_2\n            data:\n              brightness_pct: 80\n              rgb_color: [200, 220, 255]\n          - service: light.turn_on\n            target:\n              entity_id: light.wled\n            data:\n              brightness_pct: 100\n              rgb_color: [200, 220, 255]\n          - delay: \"00:00:05\"\n          - service: light.turn_off\n            target:\n              entity_id:\n                - light.hue_office_back_left\n                - light.hue_color_downlight_1_6\n                - light.hue_color_downlight_1_7\n                - light.hue_color_downlight_2_2\n\n      # After 21:00 \u2192 Office WLED 20% very warm, cleanup everything else\n      - conditions:\n          - condition: time\n            after: \"21:00:00\"\n        sequence:\n          - service: light.turn_on\n            target:\n              entity_id: light.wled\n            data:\n              brightness_pct: 20\n              rgb_color: [255, 160, 100]\n          - delay: \"00:00:05\"\n          - service: light.turn_off\n            target:\n              entity_id:\n                - light.living_room_2\n                - light.hue_office_back_left\n                - light.hue_color_downlight_1_6\n                - light.hue_color_downlight_1_7\n                - light.hue_color_downlight_2_2\n```\n\nThis respects your clarification by using **Office WLED** as the central device, explicitly dimming/brightening it instead of vague \u201cturn on\u201d actions, and only uses the devices available in your entity list.",

Evening (17:00\u201320:00)\n   - Turns **Living Room** on at 80% brightness with a neutral white (e.g., [220, 230, 255]) for a comfortable but alert atmosphere.\n   - Sets **Office** to 100% brightness, cool white (e.g., [200, 220, 255]) to keep the desk area crisp.\n   - If any of the individual office Hue bulbs (**Office Back Left**, **Office Front Left**, **Office Front Right**, **Office Back Right**) are on, they\u2019re first dimmed to ~20% for 2 seconds (creating a \u201cfocus shift\u201d to WLED) and then turned off after the 5-second wait.\n\n3. Night (After 21:00)\n   - Sets **Office** to a very low 15\u201320% brightness with an amber-like rgb_color (e.g., [255, 140, 90]) to preserve night vision.\n   - Any other lights (Living Room and office Hue bulbs) fade to **10%** over 3 seconds (via a quick brightness step + short delay) and then turn off, making the transition into night mode much less jarring.\n\nExample implementation outline (YAML with simple step-based fades):\n\n```yaml\nalias: Time-based Office WLED with Smooth Fades\nmode: single\ntrigger:\n  - platform: event\n    event_type: my_custom_time_lighting_trigger  # replace with your actual trigger\ncondition: []\naction:\n  - choose:\n      # Morning 06:00\u201309:00\n      - conditions:\n          - condition: time\n            after: \"06:00:00\"\n            before: \"09:00:00\"\n        sequence:\n          # Start very low\n          - service: light.turn_on\n            target:\n              entity_id: light.wled\n            data:\n              brightness_pct: 8\n              rgb_color: [255, 210, 170]\n          - delay: \"00:00:03\"\n          # Fade up to 50%\n          - service: light.turn_on\n            target:\n              entity_id: light.wled\n            data:\n              brightness_pct: 50\n          - delay: \"00:00:05\"\n          # Gentle cleanup \u2013 turn off other lights\n          - service: light.turn_off\n            target:\n              entity_id:\n                - light.living_room_2\n                - light.hue_office_back_left\n                - light.hue_color_downlight_1_6\n                - light.hue_color_downlight_1_7\n                - light.hue_color_downlight_2_2\n\n      # Evening 17:00\u201320:00\n      - conditions:\n          - condition: time\n            after: \"17:00:00\"\n            before: \"20:00:00\"\n        sequence:\n          - service: light.turn_on\n            target:\n              entity_id: light.living_room_2\n            data:\n              brightness_pct: 80\n              rgb_color: [220, 230, 255]\n          - service: light.turn_on\n            target:\n              entity_id: light.wled\n            data:\n              brightness_pct: 100\n              rgb_color: [200, 220, 255]\n          # Dim any stray office bulbs before turning them off\n          - service: light.turn_on\n            target:\n              entity_id:\n                - light.hue_office_back_left\n                - light.hue_color_downlight_1_6\n                - light.hue_color_downlight_1_7\n                - light.hue_color_downlight_2_2\n            data:\n              brightness_pct: 20\n          - delay: \"00:00:05\"\n          - service: light.turn_off\n            target:\n              entity_id:\n                - light.hue_office_back_left\n                - light.hue_color_downlight_1_6\n                - light.hue_color_downlight_1_7\n                - light.hue_color_downlight_2_2\n\n      # Night after 21:00\n      - conditions:\n          - condition: time\n            after: \"21:00:00\"\n        sequence:\n          - service: light.turn_on\n            target:\n              entity_id: light.wled\n            data:\n              brightness_pct: 18\n              rgb_color: [255, 140, 90]\n          # Briefly dim everything else before off\n          - service: light.turn_on\n            target:\n              entity_id:\n                - light.living_room_2\n                - light.hue_office_back_left\n                - light.hue_color_downlight_1_6\n                - light.hue_color_downlight_1_7\n                - light.hue_color_downlight_2_2\n            data:\n              brightness_pct: 10\n          - delay: \"00:00:05\"\n          - service: light.turn_off\n            target:\n              entity_id:\n                - light.living_room_2\n                - light.hue_office_back_left\n                - light.hue_color_downlight_1_6\n                - light.hue_color_downlight_1_7\n                - light.hue_color_downlight_2_2\n```\n\nThis keeps **Office WLED** as the main actor per your clarification, uses explicit dim/brighten levels instead of generic \u201cturn on\u201d, and adds simple staged fades using brightness_pct and delays\u2014staying fully within your devices\u2019 capabilities.",

If it's between 5 PM and 8 PM, turn on all living room lights to 80% and set the Office WLED to 100% with a cool white color. If it's after 9 PM, only turn on the Office WLED to 20% brightness. Wait 5 seconds after any action, then turn off all other lights that weren't part of the selected time-based action.\n\nUser clarifications:\n1. Question: Which device did you mean? Device 'lights' matches devices in wrong location. You mentioned: selected time, living_room, office, living\n   Answer: Office Wled\n2.

      "action_summary": "In plain language, the automation would:\n1. Check current time.\n2. If time is between 06:00 and 09:00:\n   - Turn on **Office** (Office WLED) at 50% brightness with a warm white tone (e.g., rgb_color around [255, 200, 150]).\n3. Else if time is between 17:00 and 20:00:\n   - Turn on **Living Room** at ~80% brightness with a neutral/cooler white (e.g., [200, 220, 255]).\n   - Turn on **Office** at 100% brightness with a cool white tone (e.g., [200, 220, 255]).\n4. Else if time is after 21:00:\n   - Turn on **Office** at 20% brightness with a very warm, low-intensity white (e.g., [255, 160, 100]) for a night-light feel.\n5. Wait 5 seconds.\n6. Turn off **all other lights** that do not match the time-based selection. Because your clarification explicitly selected **Office Wled** as the focus, the cleanup step would:\n   - After the morning or late-night Office-only scenes: turn **Living Room** off.\n   - After the evening scene (Office + Living Room): turn off any other office bulbs if they were on (e.g., **Office Back Left**, **Office Front Left**, **Office Front Right**, **Office Back Right**), keeping **Office** and **Living Room** on.\n\nImplementation outline (Home Assistant script-style YAML for the core logic):\n\n```yaml\nalias: Time-based Office WLED and Living Room\nmode: single\ntrigger:\n  - platform: event\n    event_type: my_custom_time_lighting_trigger  # replace with your real trigger (e.g. motion, button)\ncondition: []\naction:\n  - variables:\n      now_time: \"{{ now().strftime('%H:%M') }}\"\n  - choose:\n      # 06:00\u201309:00 \u2192 Office WLED 50% warm, others off after cleanup\n      - conditions:\n          - condition: time\n            after: \"06:00:00\"\n            before: \"09:00:00\"\n        sequence:\n          - service: light.turn_on\n            target:\n              entity_id: light.wled\n            data:\n              brightness_pct: 50\n              rgb_color: [255, 200, 150]\n          - delay: \"00:00:05\"\n          - service: light.turn_off\n            target:\n              entity_id:\n                - light.living_room_2\n                - light.hue_office_back_left\n                - light.hue_color_downlight_1_6\n                - light.hue_color_downlight_1_7\n                - light.hue_color_downlight_2_2\n\n      # 17:00\u201320:00 \u2192 Living Room 80% + Office WLED 100% cool, cleanup other office bulbs\n      - conditions:\n          - condition: time\n            after: \"17:00:00\"\n            before: \"20:00:00\"\n        sequence:\n          - service: light.turn_on\n            target:\n              entity_id: light.living_room_2\n            data:\n              brightness_pct: 80\n              rgb_color: [200, 220, 255]\n          - service: light.turn_on\n            target:\n              entity_id: light.wled\n            data:\n              brightness_pct: 100\n              rgb_color: [200, 220, 255]\n          - delay: \"00:00:05\"\n          - service: light.turn_off\n            target:\n              entity_id:\n                - light.hue_office_back_left\n                - light.hue_color_downlight_1_6\n                - light.hue_color_downlight_1_7\n                - light.hue_color_downlight_2_2\n\n      # After 21:00 \u2192 Office WLED 20% very warm, cleanup everything else\n      - conditions:\n          - condition: time\n            after: \"21:00:00\"\n        sequence:\n          - service: light.turn_on\n            target:\n              entity_id: light.wled\n            data:\n              brightness_pct: 20\n              rgb_color: [255, 160, 100]\n          - delay: \"00:00:05\"\n          - service: light.turn_off\n            target:\n              entity_id:\n                - light.living_room_2\n                - light.hue_office_back_left\n                - light.hue_color_downlight_1_6\n                - light.hue_color_downlight_1_7\n                - light.hue_color_downlight_2_2\n```\n\nThis respects your clarification by using **Office WLED** as the central device, explicitly dimming/brightening it instead of vague \u201cturn on\u201d actions, and only uses the devices available in your entity list."
