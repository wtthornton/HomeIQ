If it's daytime (6 AM to 6 PM) and the Office WLED is below 50%, turn it on to 70%. If it's nighttime (6 PM to 6 AM) and any living room light is above 60%, dim the Office WLED to 30%. If the Office WLED is already at the target brightness, do nothing. Wait 2 seconds between each check and action.",
