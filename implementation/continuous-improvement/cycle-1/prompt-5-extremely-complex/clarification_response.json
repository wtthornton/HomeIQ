Because only two lights are available in your Home Assistant context (\"Living Room \" and \"New hallway front\") and you explicitly chose the Living Room Light in clarifications, this version treats that as the main light for both your morning and evening arrival. It mirrors your original logic as closely as possible, but omits thermostat control, music, and multi-speaker announcements since those entities are not present in the provided context.",

Q: Which device did you mean? Device 'light' matches devices in wrong location. You mentioned: living_room, hallway, living, bedroom\nA: Living Room Light\n3. Q: Could you clarify: Action 'turn' is vague - missing details: off, dim, brighten\nA: Yes\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS (MUST FOLLOW):\n- Use the EXACT devices/locations mentioned in the answers above\n- If the user specified specific devices, use ONLY those devices (e.g., \"all four lights in office\")\n- If the user selected specific entities, use ONLY those entities from the enriched context\n- Respect the user's choices - do NOT use different devices than what they specified\n- If the user said \"all four lights in office\", find ALL FOUR lights from the office area in the enriched context\n- If the user selected specific entities, prioritize those exact entities over generic device names\n- The clarification answers OVERRIDE any assumptions you might make from the original query\n- If the user answered \"office\" for location, use ONLY devices from the office area\n- If the user selected specific entity IDs, use those EXACT entity IDs in devices_involved\n\nDO NOT:\n- Use devices from different locations (e.g., outdoor lights when user said \"office\")\n- Use generic device names when user specified exact devices\n- Ignore user-selected entities\n- Make assumptions that contradict the clarification answers\n\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\n\n\nCAPABILITY-SPECIFIC AUTOMATION IDEAS:\n- Use available device capabilities creatively\n\nPATTERN GUIDANCE:\nCORE DELIVERY PATTERN\n- Anchor every suggestion to the user's stated intent before expanding\n- Summarize the user scenario in one sentence to keep responses grounded\n- Call out the Home Assistant outcome in plain language before any YAML or technical details\nOUTPUT PROGRESSION\n- FIRST suggestion focuses on immediate fulfillment of the request with minimal prerequisites\n- SECOND suggestion layers in a meaningful enhancement that remains practical for a single-home setup\n\nCLARIFICATION REQUIREMENTS\n- Explicitly reference each answered question so the user sees how their input was applied\n- If any requested entity is unavailable, explain the gap and propose the closest safe alternative\n- Never add extra devices or rooms beyond those confirmed in clarifications\n\nSAFETY CHECKLIST\n- Avoid automations that could leave appliances running unattended for long periods\n- Respect device health scores - suggest manual intervention if all options score below 50\n- Flag actions that modify security sensors or door locks and require explicit confirmation\n\nCREATIVE FLOURISH\n- Tie enhancements to real household benefits such as comfort, energy savings, or ambiance\n- Use no more than one advanced capability (e.g., color loops, adaptive scenes) per suggestion\n- Offer a short note describing why the enhancement is valuable for a single occupant\n\nCRITICAL: DEVICE NAMING REQUIREMENTS:\n- ONLY use devices that are listed in the \"Available devices and capabilities\" section OR the \"ENRICHED ENTITY CONTEXT\" section above\n- Count how many devices are actually available - DO NOT assume a specific number\n- Use ACTUAL device friendly names from the enriched entity context JSON - DO NOT make up generic names like \"Device 1\" or \"office lights\"\n- Reference devices by their EXACT friendly_name from the entities list\n- If the enriched context shows 6 individual lights, list all 6 with their actual names\n- DO NOT use group entity names unless the enriched context shows it's a group entity\n- Example: If enriched context shows [\"Office light 1\", \"Office light 2\", \"Office light 3\"], use those exact names\n\nGenerate EXACTLY 2 suggestions that PROGRESS from CLOSE to your request \u2192 to ENHANCED CREATIVE:\n\nPROGRESSION STRATEGY:\n1. FIRST suggestion: Direct, straightforward automation closely matching the request\n   - Simple implementation\n   - Exactly what was asked for\n   - High confidence (0.9+)\n   \n2. SECOND suggestion: Enhanced variation building on the request\n   - Practical improvements\n   - Leverage device capabilities\n   - Moderate-high confidence (0.8-0.9)\n\nAll suggestions should:\n- Be practical and achievable\n- Leverage the specific capabilities of available devices\n- Be safe and user-friendly\n- Consider device health scores (avoid devices with health_score < 50)\n\nThe progression should show INCREASING CREATIVITY from first to last.\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your response as a JSON array of suggestion objects, each with these fields:\n- description: A detailed description of the automation\n- trigger_summary: What triggers the automation\n- action_summary: What actions will be performed\n- devices_involved: Array of device names - MUST use EXACT friendly_name values from the enriched entity context JSON above\n- capabilities_used: Array of device capabilities being used\n- confidence: A confidence score between 0 and 1 (higher for conservative, lower for creative)\n\nCRITICAL: For devices_involved, extract the exact \"friendly_name\" values from the enriched entity context JSON. Do NOT invent generic names like \"Device 1\" or \"office lights\". Use the actual device names from the entities array in the enriched context.\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f IMPORTANT: If clarification context is provided:\n- The user has already answered specific questions about their automation request\n- Use the EXACT devices, locations, and preferences specified in the clarification answers\n- If the user selected specific entities in Q&A, use ONLY those entities\n- If the user specified \"all four lights in office\", find and list all four lights from the office area\n- The clarification answers take PRECEDENCE over any assumptions from the original query\n- DO NOT use different devices than what the user explicitly selected or confirmed in the Q&A\n\n[NOTE: Entity context filtered to show only 2 entities used in this suggestion out of 45 available]",

Morning arrivals get a warm, medium-bright welcome; evening arrivals get a cozy, slightly dimmed amber scene; and late-night arrivals get a very low, warm hallway glow.
