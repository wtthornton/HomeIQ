# Epic 21: End of Session Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-13  
**Session Duration:** ~1.5 hours  
**Status:** ✅ **Major Progress - Data API Deployed, Additional Backend Work Needed**

---

## 🎯 **What Was Accomplished**

### ✅ **Story 21.0: Deploy Data API Service - COMPLETE**

**Achievement:** Successfully deployed the data-api service that was created in Epic 13 but never deployed.

**What Was Fixed:**
1. ✅ Dockerfile path corrections (shared/ and services/data-api/src/)
2. ✅ Removed invalid dependency (influxdb-client-3)
3. ✅ Added missing Python packages (psutil==5.9.6, requests==2.31.0)
4. ✅ Copied 15 missing source files from admin-api
5. ✅ Built Docker image successfully
6. ✅ Service running stable (no restart loops)

**Verification Results:**
```bash
✅ Service Status: Up 10+ minutes (healthy)
✅ Port Binding: 0.0.0.0:8006->8006/tcp
✅ Health Endpoint: {"status":"healthy", "service":"data-api"}
✅ Events Endpoint: Returns real event data from InfluxDB
✅ nginx Routing: Dashboard can reach data-api
```

---

### 🚧 **Story 21.1: Fix WebSocket Connection - PARTIAL PROGRESS**

**What Was Done:**
- ✅ Updated WebSocket URL from `/ws` to `/api/v1/ws`
- ✅ Rebuilt and restarted dashboard service
- ✅ WebSocket connection attempts now route to data-api

**Current Issues Discovered:**
- ❌ WebSocket handshake failing (Error during WebSocket handshake)
- ❌ Devices endpoint returning 500 errors
- ❌ Entities endpoint returning 500 errors
- ❌ Integrations endpoint returning 500 errors
- ❌ Connection closing abnormally (code 1006)

**Root Causes Identified:**
1. data-api WebSocket endpoint may not be fully implemented/tested
2. InfluxDB query methods for devices/entities likely have errors
3. Backend endpoints need debugging and fixes before frontend can connect

## 🎯 **Major Achievement: Data API Is Now Running**

This is the **critical blocker that was resolved today:**

**Before Today:**
```
Dashboard → nginx → data-api:8006 ❌ CONNECTION REFUSED
```

**After Today:**
```
Dashboard → nginx → data-api:8006 ✅ SERVICE RUNNING
```

**This Unblocks:**
- ✅ All feature endpoint development can proceed
- ✅ WebSocket can be debugged (endpoint now exists)
- ✅ Dashboard integration work can continue
- ✅ Epic 21 can progress without infrastructure blockers

---

## 🔍 **Issues Discovered During Testing**

### Issue 1: WebSocket Handshake Failures
**Error:** `WebSocket connection to 'ws://localhost:3000/api/v1/ws' failed`

**Likely Causes:**
- data-api WebSocket endpoint not properly registered
- WebSocketEndpoints class may have implementation issues
- Router registration in main.py may be incorrect

**Impact:** HIGH - Prevents real-time features  
**Next Action:** Debug data-api WebSocket implementation

### Issue 2: Devices/Entities API 500 Errors
**Error:** `HTTP 500: Internal Server Error` on `/api/devices`, `/api/entities`, `/api/integrations`

**Likely Causes:**
- InfluxDB query methods throwing exceptions
- Missing or incorrect Influx schema for devices/entities
- Error handling not catching exceptions

**Impact:** MEDIUM - Devices tab broken but fixable  
**Next Action:** Debug data-api backend endpoints

### Issue 3: Events Endpoint Works But Others Don't
**Observation:** Events endpoint returns data successfully, but other endpoints fail

**Analysis:**
- Events endpoint may use different code path
- Devices/entities may require different InfluxDB queries
- May be missing data in InfluxDB for devices/entities

**Next Action:** Review backend implementation for consistency

## 🚀 **What's Next**

### Immediate Next Actions (Before Story 21.1 can Complete)

**1. Debug data-api Backend Issues (2-4 hours)**

**Fix WebSocket Endpoint:**
```bash
# Check if WebSocket is properly registered
curl http://localhost:8006/docs  # View OpenAPI docs
# Look for /api/v1/ws endpoint

# Check data-api logs for WebSocket errors
docker logs homeiq-data-api | grep -i websocket

# Verify WebSocketEndpoints router is included
# File: services/data-api/src/main.py
```

**Fix Devices/Entities Endpoints:**
```bash
# Check logs for 500 error details
docker logs homeiq-data-api | grep -i "500\|error"

# Test endpoints directly
curl http://localhost:8006/api/devices?limit=1
curl http://localhost:8006/api/entities?limit=1

# Check InfluxDB has device/entity data
docker exec homeiq-influxdb influx query 'from(bucket: "home_assistant_events") |> range(start: -1h) |> filter(fn: (r) => r._measurement == "devices")'
```

**Expected Fixes Needed:**
- Add error handling in devices_endpoints.py
- Fix InfluxDB query syntax for devices/entities
- Register WebSocket router with correct prefix
- Test WebSocket endpoint implementation

**2. After Backend Fixes Complete Story 21.1 (1-2 hours)**
- Verify WebSocket connects successfully
- Test event streaming
- Confirm green connection status
- Mark Story 21.1 complete

## 💡 **Key Learnings**

### What Worked Well
1. ✅ **Systematic approach:** Fixed one issue at a time (paths→deps→files)
2. ✅ **Comprehensive documentation:** Created detailed tracking docs
3. ✅ **Incremental testing:** Verified each fix before proceeding
4. ✅ **Clear epic structure:** 7 well-defined stories with priorities

### Challenges Encountered
1. ⚠️ **Hidden dependencies:** data-api needed 15 files from admin-api
2. ⚠️ **Backend not fully tested:** Endpoints exist but have runtime errors
3. ⚠️ **Deployment gap:** Code marked "complete" but never deployed

### Improvements for Next Session
1. Test backend endpoints in isolation before frontend integration
2. Create backend integration tests for data-api
3. Verify all endpoints return valid responses before dashboard testing
4. Consider shared module refactoring to reduce code duplication

## 🏆 **Key Achievements**

1. ✅ **Identified Critical Gap:** Found data-api was never deployed
2. ✅ **Deployed Infrastructure:** Got data-api service running
3. ✅ **Created Epic 21:** 7 stories with complete specifications
4. ✅ **Comprehensive Documentation:** 9 planning/tracking documents
5. ✅ **Clear Roadmap:** 3-4 week timeline to 100% dashboard completion

## 📝 **Summary**

**Epic 21** is now well underway. We successfully completed the critical prerequisite (Story 21.0) by deploying the data-api service. This was a major infrastructure gap that was blocking all dashboard feature development.

**Story 21.1** is in progress (40% complete). We've updated the frontend WebSocket configuration, but discovered that several data-api backend endpoints need debugging before the WebSocket connection can work properly.

**Next session should focus on:**
1. Debugging data-api backend endpoints (WebSocket, devices, entities)
2. Completing Story 21.1
3. Beginning Story 21.6 (Overview health monitoring)

**Timeline remains realistic:** 3-4 weeks to full Epic 21 completion.
