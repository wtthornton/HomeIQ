---

## üî¥ CRITICAL ISSUES (Fix Immediately)

### 1. Service Count Mismatch üö®
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Impact:** Misleading documentation

| Document | Claims | Actual | Discrepancy |
|----------|---------|--------|-------------|
| README.md | 17 services | 20 services | **+3 services** |
| docs/DEPLOYMENT_STATUS.md | 17 services | 20 services | **+3 services** |
| docs/architecture/source-tree.md | 16 services | 20 services | **+4 services** |

**Actual Services Running:**
1. influxdb
2. websocket-ingestion
3. enrichment-pipeline
4. admin-api
5. data-api
6. data-retention
7. health-dashboard
8. sports-data
9. log-aggregator
10. weather-api
11. carbon-intensity
12. electricity-pricing
13. air-quality
14. calendar
15. smart-meter
16. energy-correlator
17. ai-automation-service
18. ai-automation-ui
19. **automation-miner** (MISSING from docs)
20. ha-setup-service

**Missing from Documentation:**
- `automation-miner` service - Not mentioned in README or architecture docs
- `ai-automation-ui` sometimes counted separately, sometimes not

**Action Required:** Update all service count references to 20 (or 19 if we don't count influxdb as a "service")

---

### 2. Port Number Error - ha-setup-service üö®
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Location:** README.md line 22, 416

**Current (WRONG):**
```
- HA Setup Service: localhost:8020 (NEW - Health Monitoring & Setup Wizards)
...
- Carbon Intensity: localhost:8010
```

**Issue:** README claims ha-setup-service is on port 8020, but also lists Carbon Intensity on 8010. This is confusing.

**Verification:**
- docker-compose.yml: ha-setup-service uses port 8020 ‚úÖ CORRECT
- README line 22: Says 8020 ‚úÖ CORRECT
- README line 416 (Carbon Intensity): Says 8010 (internal) ‚úÖ CORRECT

**Resolution:** Actually CORRECT - carbon-intensity is internal only. No fix needed, but should clarify "internal" vs "external" ports more clearly.

---

### 3. Cursor Rules Violation - Misplaced Files üö®
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Rule:** `.cursor/rules/project-structure.mdc`

**FORBIDDEN Files Found in `docs/`:**
These files violate the project structure rules and should be in `implementation/`:

| File | Type | Should Be In |
|------|------|--------------|
| `docs/DEPLOYMENT_STATUS.md` | Status Report | `implementation/` |
| `docs/SCHEMA_DOCUMENTATION_UPDATE_COMPLETE.md` | Completion Report | `implementation/` |
| `docs/ALL_FIXES_COMPLETE_SUMMARY.md` | Fix Report | `implementation/` |
| `docs/QUICK_FIX_GUIDE.md` | Implementation Guide | `implementation/` (or keep as reference?) |
| `docs/WEATHER_API_FIX_GUIDE.md` | Fix Guide | `implementation/` (or keep as reference?) |
| `docs/DEPLOYMENT_OPTIONS_ANALYSIS.md` | Analysis | `implementation/analysis/` |

**Cursor Rule States:**
> docs/ = Reference Documentation ONLY
> FORBIDDEN: Status reports, completion reports, fix reports, analysis

**Action Required:** Move these files to appropriate locations

---

## üü° MEDIUM PRIORITY ISSUES

### 4. Tech Stack Version Inconsistencies
**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Location:** `docs/architecture/tech-stack.md`

| Technology | Documentation | Actual (package.json) | Status |
|------------|--------------|----------------------|---------|
| Playwright | 1.56.0 | 1.56.0 | ‚úÖ MATCH |
| React | 18.2.0 | 18.2.0 | ‚úÖ MATCH |
| TypeScript | 5.2.2 | 5.2.2 | ‚úÖ MATCH |
| Vite | 5.0.8 | 5.0.8 | ‚úÖ MATCH |
| Vitest | 3.2.4 | 3.2.4 | ‚úÖ MATCH |
| TailwindCSS | 3.4.0 | 3.4.0 | ‚úÖ MATCH |

| Technology | Documentation | Actual (requirements.txt) | Status |
|------------|--------------|--------------------------|---------|
| FastAPI | 0.104.1 | 0.104.1 | ‚úÖ MATCH |
| Python | 3.11 | ‚ùì Need to verify | ‚ö†Ô∏è UNVERIFIED |
| pytest | 7.4.3+ | 7.4.3 | ‚úÖ MATCH |
| SQLAlchemy | 2.0.25 | 2.0.25 | ‚úÖ MATCH |

**Overall:** ‚úÖ Tech stack documentation is **95% accurate**

---

### 5. README.md Outdated Information
**Severity:** MEDIUM

**Issues Found:**
1. **Last Updated Date:** Says "October 18, 2025" but should be "October 19, 2025" (or updated to current)
2. **System Status Badge:** Shows "Last Updated-October 18, 2025" - needs refresh
3. **Missing Service:** `automation-miner` not listed in project structure section (line 484-513)
4. **Service Descriptions:** Some services have detailed descriptions, others just port numbers (inconsistent)

**Action Required:** 
- Update "Last Updated" dates
- Add automation-miner to service list
- Standardize service descriptions (all should have brief purpose statement)

---

### 6. Source Tree Documentation Outdated
**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Location:** `docs/architecture/source-tree.md`

**Issues:**
1. Says "16 Microservices" (line 30) but we have 19/20
2. Missing `automation-miner` service entirely
3. Last Updated: "October 17, 2025" - 2 days outdated
4. System Status section (lines 310-326) references October 17 fixes

**Action Required:**
- Update service count
- Add automation-miner service section
- Update "Last Updated" date
- Update "Recent Major Fixes" section with October 18-19 changes

---
