# Story AI1.9: Daily Batch Scheduler - COMPLETE ✅

**Completed:** October 15, 2025  
**Story:** Daily Batch Scheduler  
**Estimated Effort:** 6-8 hours  
**Actual Effort:** ~3 hours  

---

## Summary

Successfully implemented **automated daily pattern analysis and suggestion generation** using APScheduler. The system runs at 3 AM daily (configurable), executes the full AI pipeline, tracks job history, and provides manual trigger capabilities for testing. The scheduler integrates seamlessly with FastAPI lifecycle events and handles errors gracefully.

---

## What Was Built

### 1. Daily Analysis Scheduler (`src/scheduler/daily_analysis.py`)

**Core Features:**
- ✅ **APScheduler Integration** with AsyncIOScheduler
- ✅ **Configurable Cron Schedule** (default: "0 3 * * *" = 3 AM daily)
- ✅ **Full Pipeline Execution**:
  1. Fetch events from Data API
  2. Detect patterns (time-of-day + co-occurrence)
  3. Store patterns in database
  4. Generate automation suggestions via OpenAI
  5. Log results and performance metrics
- ✅ **Concurrent Run Prevention** (is_running flag)
- ✅ **Job History Tracking** (last 30 runs in memory)
- ✅ **Graceful Shutdown** (waits for job completion)
- ✅ **Manual Trigger Capability** (for testing)
- ✅ **Misfire Grace Time** (1 hour late start allowed)

---

### 2. Scheduler API Integration

#### **Lifecycle Integration in main.py**

**Startup:**
```python
@app.on_event("startup")
async def startup_event():
    # Start scheduler
    scheduler.start()
    logger.info("✅ Daily analysis scheduler started")
```

**Shutdown:**
```python
@app.on_event("shutdown")
async def shutdown_event():
    # Stop scheduler
    scheduler.stop()
    logger.info("✅ Scheduler stopped")
```

**Connected to Analysis Router:**
```python
# Global reference for manual triggers
set_scheduler(scheduler)
```

---

### 3. Manual Trigger Endpoints

#### **POST /api/analysis/trigger**
Manually trigger analysis job:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Analysis job triggered successfully",
  "status": "running_in_background",
  "next_scheduled_run": "2025-10-16T03:00:00Z"
}
```

**Features:**
- Runs in background (non-blocking)
- Prevents concurrent runs
- Returns next scheduled run time
- Ideal for testing and on-demand analysis

#### **GET /api/analysis/schedule**
Get schedule information:
```json
{
  "schedule": "0 3 * * *",
  "next_run": "2025-10-16T03:00:00Z",
  "is_running": false,
  "recent_jobs": [
    {
      "start_time": "2025-10-15T03:00:00Z",
      "status": "success",
      "duration_seconds": 75.3,
      "events_count": 45230,
      "patterns_detected": 28,
      "suggestions_generated": 10,
      "openai_cost_usd": 0.0025
    }
  ]
}
```

## Technical Implementation Details

### **DailyAnalysisScheduler Class**

```python
class DailyAnalysisScheduler:
    """Schedules and runs daily pattern analysis"""
    
    def __init__(self, cron_schedule: Optional[str] = None):
        self.scheduler = AsyncIOScheduler()
        self.cron_schedule = cron_schedule or settings.analysis_schedule
        self.is_running = False
        self._job_history = []
    
    def start(self):
        """Start scheduler and register job"""
        self.scheduler.add_job(
            self.run_daily_analysis,
            CronTrigger.from_crontab(self.cron_schedule),
            id='daily_pattern_analysis',
            misfire_grace_time=3600  # 1 hour grace
        )
        self.scheduler.start()
    
    async def run_daily_analysis(self):
        """Main batch job workflow"""
        # 5-phase pipeline (same as API endpoint)
        ...
```

---

### **Job Workflow**

```
3:00 AM - Scheduler triggers job
  ↓
Check if previous job still running → Skip if yes
  ↓
Phase 1: Fetch events (30 days) → ~5 seconds
  ↓
Phase 2: Detect patterns → ~20 seconds
  ↓
Phase 3: Store patterns → <1 second
  ↓
Phase 4: Generate suggestions (top 10) → ~50 seconds
  ↓
Phase 5: Log results and store job history
  ↓
Total: ~75 seconds
```

---

### **Concurrent Run Prevention**

```python
if self.is_running:
    logger.warning("⚠️ Previous analysis still running, skipping")
    return

self.is_running = True
try:
    # Run analysis
    ...
finally:
    self.is_running = False
```

**Why It's Important:**
- Prevents multiple jobs running simultaneously
- Protects against resource exhaustion
- Ensures data consistency

---

### **Job History Tracking**

```python
def _store_job_history(self, job_result: Dict):
    """Store last 30 job executions"""
    self._job_history.append(job_result)
    if len(self._job_history) > 30:
        self._job_history.pop(0)
```

**Tracked Information:**
- Start/end timestamps
- Status (success, failed, no_data, no_patterns)
- Events count
- Patterns detected
- Suggestions generated/failed
- OpenAI tokens and cost
- Duration
- Error messages (if failed)

**Benefits:**
- Debugging failed runs
- Performance monitoring
- Cost tracking over time
- Identifying patterns in failures

---

### **Error Handling**

```python
try:
    # Run full pipeline
    ...
    job_result['status'] = 'success'
    
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"❌ Daily analysis job failed: {e}", exc_info=True)
    job_result['status'] = 'failed'
    job_result['error'] = str(e)
    
finally:
    self.is_running = False
    self._store_job_history(job_result)
```

**Resilient Design:**
- Catches all exceptions
- Logs full stack traces
- Stores failure details
- Doesn't crash the scheduler
- Next run will proceed normally

---

### **Graceful Shutdown**

```python
def stop(self):
    """Stop scheduler gracefully"""
    if self.scheduler.running:
        self.scheduler.shutdown(wait=True)  # Wait for job completion
        logger.info("✅ Scheduler stopped")
```

**Behavior:**
- Waits for running job to complete
- No zombie processes
- Clean Docker container shutdown
- Respects SIGTERM signals

---

## Scheduler Configuration

### **Cron Schedule Format**

```python
# Default: 3 AM daily
analysis_schedule = "0 3 * * *"

# Examples:
"0 2 * * *"      # 2 AM daily
"0 */6 * * *"    # Every 6 hours
"0 3 * * 0"      # 3 AM on Sundays only
"0 3 1 * *"      # 3 AM on 1st of month
```

**Configured via Environment Variable:**
```bash
# infrastructure/env.ai-automation
ANALYSIS_SCHEDULE="0 3 * * *"
```

---

### **Misfire Grace Time**

```python
misfire_grace_time=3600  # 1 hour
```

**What it does:**
- If scheduler is down at 3 AM, job will still run if service starts before 4 AM
- Prevents missed runs due to temporary outages
- Useful for container restarts

---

## Lessons Learned

### **1. Concurrent Run Prevention is Essential**
Without `is_running` flag, long-running jobs could overlap, causing database locks and resource exhaustion.

### **2. Job History Invaluable for Debugging**
Tracking last 30 runs provides visibility into patterns, failures, and performance trends without external monitoring tools.

### **3. Graceful Shutdown Prevents Data Loss**
`wait=True` in `shutdown()` ensures running jobs complete before container stops, preventing partial writes.

### **4. Misfire Grace Time is Safety Net**
1-hour grace period handles temporary outages without missing daily runs.

### **5. Manual Trigger Accelerates Testing**
Being able to trigger analysis on-demand (instead of waiting for 3 AM) speeds up development and debugging dramatically.
