### ⚠️ Event Processing Services (2/2) - RUNNING BUT BLOCKED

#### 6. WebSocket Ingestion (Port 8001) ⚠️ **CRITICAL ISSUE**
```
Status: Docker says "healthy" but health check reports "unhealthy"
Container: homeiq-websocket
CPU: 0.07%
Memory: 42.17 MiB / 512 MiB (8%)

Logs:
✅ Service started successfully
✅ Connected to Home Assistant (ws://192.168.1.86:8123)
✅ InfluxDB manager started
✅ Device discovery started
✅ WebSocket connection manager started
✅ Service reports "started successfully"

**CRITICAL ERROR:**
❌ ALL HOME ASSISTANT EVENTS FAILING TO PROCESS
❌ Error: AttributeError: 'WebSocketIngestionService' object has no attribute 'weather_enrichment'
❌ Location: /app/src/main.py line 360 in _on_event
❌ Impact: ZERO events making it through to InfluxDB

Error Pattern:
- Event received from HA → Triggers _on_event handler
- Line 360: Checks "if self.weather_enrichment:"
- Attribute doesn't exist → AttributeError
- Event processing aborts → Event lost
- Repeating for EVERY event

Event Count:
❌ Processed successfully: 0
❌ Failed: All (continuous errors every few seconds)

**Root Cause:** Epic 31 weather migration incomplete
- weather_enrichment attribute removed but code still references it
- Needs immediate fix
```

```
Status: HEALTHY
Container: homeiq-enrichment
CPU: 0.02%

## EVENT PROCESSING ANALYSIS

### ❌ CRITICAL ISSUE: Event Pipeline Blocked

**Flow Diagram:**
```
Home Assistant (192.168.1.86:8123)
    ↓ WebSocket
[1] websocket-ingestion (Port 8001) ❌ BLOCKED HERE
    ↓ Internal HTTP
[2] enrichment-pipeline (Port 8002) ⏸️ No events received
    ↓ InfluxDB Write
[3] InfluxDB (Port 8086) ⏸️ No writes
    ↓ Query
[4] data-api (Port 8006) ⏸️ No events to query
    ↓ HTTP API
[5] Dashboard (Port 3000) ⏸️ No events to display
```

**Problem Location:** Step 1 - websocket-ingestion

**Error Details:**
```
Service: websocket-ingestion
Location: /app/src/main.py line 360
Function: _on_event (event handler)
Error: AttributeError: 'WebSocketIngestionService' object has no attribute 'weather_enrichment'

Code causing error:
    if self.weather_enrichment:
       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 
       
Impact: ALL events fail to process
Frequency: Every event received (continuous errors)
Events lost: 100% of incoming events
```

**Events Received vs Processed:**
```
Received from HA: Many (errors repeating every few seconds)
Successfully Processed: 0 ❌
Failed: All (100%)
Stored in InfluxDB: 0
```

## CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND

### 🚨 Issue #1: Event Processing Completely Blocked (CRITICAL)

**Service:** websocket-ingestion  
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Impact:** 100% of Home Assistant events are lost

**Error:**
```python
AttributeError: 'WebSocketIngestionService' object has no attribute 'weather_enrichment'
File: /app/src/main.py, line 360
```

**Root Cause:** Epic 31 weather migration incomplete
- Weather enrichment was disabled/removed
- Code still checks for `self.weather_enrichment` attribute
- Attribute was never properly initialized or removed

**Fix Required:** Immediate
```python
# Line 360 in websocket-ingestion/src/main.py
# REMOVE or COMMENT OUT:
if self.weather_enrichment:
    # weather enrichment code

# OR INITIALIZE in __init__:
self.weather_enrichment = None  # or False
```

**Estimated Fix Time:** 15 minutes  
**Priority:** CRITICAL (P0)

---

### ⚠️ Issue #2: Webhook Event Detector InfluxDB Connection (MEDIUM)

**Service:** data-api  
**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Impact:** Webhook event detection not working

**Error:**
```
Error in webhook event detector: InfluxDB client not connected
```

**Frequency:** Recurring (every few seconds)

**Root Cause:** Webhook detector trying to query InfluxDB before client initialized or using wrong client instance

**Impact:** 
- Sports game webhooks may not trigger properly
- Event detection functionality impaired

**Fix Required:** Medium priority

---

### ⚠️ Issue #3: Setup Service Integration Warnings (LOW)

**Service:** ha-setup-service  
**Severity:** LOW  
**Impact:** Service functional but reports some integrations unhealthy

**Details:**
- Health score: 88/100 (good)
- Only 2/6 integrations healthy
- Admin API integration has errors

**Impact:** Non-critical, service operational

---

## SERVICES NOT PROCESSING EVENTS

Because websocket-ingestion is blocked, the following services have NO data to process:

- ❌ enrichment-pipeline - Waiting for events (upstream blocked)
- ❌ InfluxDB - No writes (no events)
- ❌ data-api - No events to query
- ❌ Dashboard Events tab - No events to display
- ❌ Dashboard Analytics tab - No data to analyze

**All services are READY and HEALTHY, just no data flowing through the pipeline.**

### Q: Are events being processed?
**A: ❌ NO - Event processing is completely blocked**

**Status:**
```
Home Assistant Events:
✅ Connecting: YES (websocket connected)
✅ Receiving: YES (events arriving from HA)
❌ Processing: NO (all events failing with AttributeError)
❌ Storing: NO (no events reaching InfluxDB)
❌ Available in Dashboard: NO (no events in database)
```

**Blocker:**
```
AttributeError at websocket-ingestion line 360
'weather_enrichment' attribute doesn't exist
ALL events fail → ZERO events processed
```

**Impact Level:** 🚨 **CRITICAL**
- Core functionality (event ingestion) is broken
- No new events since deployment
- Historical data may still be in database
- All services healthy but starving for data

---

---

### ❌ Pre-Existing Issues: 1 CRITICAL

**Issue:** Event processing blocked  
**Source:** Epic 31 (weather migration)  
**Related to Epic 32:** NO  
**Requires:** Immediate fix

---

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### 🚨 IMMEDIATE (CRITICAL - Fix Now)

**Fix WebSocket Event Processing:**
```bash
# Edit services/websocket-ingestion/src/main.py
# Line 360: Remove or fix weather_enrichment check

# Option 1: Remove the check
# DELETE lines that reference self.weather_enrichment

# Option 2: Initialize the attribute
# In __init__: self.weather_enrichment = None

# Option 3: Use proper check
# if hasattr(self, 'weather_enrichment') and self.weather_enrichment:

Then rebuild:
docker-compose restart homeiq-websocket
```

**Estimated Time:** 15 minutes  
**Impact:** Restores event processing to 100%

---

### ⏰ SHORT-TERM (Medium Priority)

**Fix Webhook Detector:**
- Investigate InfluxDB client initialization in data-api
- Ensure client is available before webhook detector starts
- Add proper error handling

**Fix Setup Service Integrations:**
- Review integration health checks
- Fix Admin API integration
- Improve integration status reporting

---

### ✅ LONG-TERM (Optional)

**Address Deprecation Warnings:**
- Migrate admin-api from on_event to lifespan handlers
- Update to current FastAPI patterns

**Manual QA Epic 32:**
- Test Analytics tab UI (when events available)
- Test Alerts tab UI
- Verify no visual regressions

---
