## 🎯 Context7 KB Integration [[memory:10014278]]

### Context7 Tools Used

1. **`mcp_Context7_resolve-library-id`:**
   - httpx → `/encode/httpx` (249 snippets, trust 7.5)
   - beautifulsoup4 → `/wention/beautifulsoup4` (176 snippets, trust 8.2)
   - pydantic → `/pydantic/pydantic` (530 snippets, trust 9.6)
   - apscheduler → `/agronholm/apscheduler` (68 snippets, trust 9.3)

2. **`mcp_Context7_get-library-docs`:**
   - **httpx:** Async client, retry logic, timeout, connection pooling
   - **Pydantic:** BaseModel validation, field_validator, TypeAdapter
   - **APScheduler:** AsyncScheduler, CronTrigger, weekly scheduling

### Best Practices Validated

**httpx Async Client:**
```python
# Retry + timeout + connection pooling
transport = httpx.AsyncHTTPTransport(retries=3)
timeout = Timeout(connect=10.0, read=30.0, write=10.0, pool=10.0)
limits = Limits(max_keepalive_connections=5, max_connections=10)

async with AsyncClient(transport=transport, timeout=timeout, limits=limits) as client:
    response = await client.get("...")
```

**Pydantic Validation:**
```python
class AutomationMetadata(BaseModel):
    title: str = Field(min_length=5, max_length=200)
    devices: List[str] = Field(default_factory=list)
    quality_score: float = Field(ge=0.0, le=1.0)
    
    @field_validator('devices')
    @classmethod
    def normalize_devices(cls, v: List[str]) -> List[str]:
        return [d.lower().replace(' ', '_') for d in v]
```

**APScheduler Weekly Job:**
```python
from apscheduler import AsyncScheduler
from apscheduler.triggers.cron import CronTrigger

async with AsyncScheduler() as scheduler:
    await scheduler.add_schedule(
        weekly_refresh_job.run,
        CronTrigger(day_of_week='sun', hour=2, minute=0),
        id="weekly_corpus_refresh",
        max_instances=1,
        coalesce=True,
        misfire_grace_time=3600
    )
```

## 📊 User Requirements Met

### ✅ Use BMAD Process
- Epic created following `brownfield-create-epic.md` task
- Stories created following `brownfield-create-story.md` task
- Story template (`story-tmpl.yaml`) followed

### ✅ Include Weekly Refresh
- Story AI4.4 implements weekly incremental crawl
- Scheduled: Sunday 2 AM (APScheduler CronTrigger)
- Duration: 15-30 minutes (vs 3 hours initial)
- Automatic cache invalidation after refresh

### ✅ Do Not Over-Engineer
- **Simple stack:** httpx + Pydantic + SQLite + APScheduler (no ML, no heavy libs)
- **Selective crawling:** 500+ votes only (quality over quantity)
- **Rule-based:** Keyword classification, no NLP/embeddings
- **In-memory caching:** No Redis needed
- **Integrated module:** Can run in ai-automation-service (no separate microservice required)

### ✅ Leverage Context7
- All stories include Context7-validated best practices
- Code examples from official documentation
- Performance patterns (async, retry, timeout)
- Security patterns (validation, error handling)
