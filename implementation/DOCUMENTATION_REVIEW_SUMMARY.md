## 📊 System Architecture Summary

### Data Flow Overview
```
Home Assistant (WebSocket)
    ↓
WebSocket Ingestion (8001)
    ├─ Event Processing
    ├─ Weather Enrichment
    ├─ Device/Entity Discovery (Epic 23)
    └─ Batch Processing
    ↓ HTTP POST
Enrichment Pipeline (8002)
    ├─ Validation
    ├─ Normalization
    └─ InfluxDB Write
    ↓
InfluxDB (8086) + SQLite
    ↓ Queries
Data API (8006) + Admin API (8003)
    ↓ HTTP Polling
Health Dashboard (3000)
```

### Key Integrations

**Primary Data Path:**
1. Home Assistant → WebSocket Ingestion (real-time)
2. WebSocket Ingestion → Enrichment Pipeline (HTTP batch, 5s)
3. Enrichment Pipeline → InfluxDB (Line Protocol)
4. Data API ← InfluxDB/SQLite (queries)
5. Health Dashboard ← Data API/Admin API (HTTP polling)

**Sports Data Path:**
1. ESPN API → Sports Data Service (15s live, 5m upcoming)
2. Sports Data → InfluxDB (game scores)
3. Sports Data → SQLite (webhooks - Epic 22.3)
4. Sports Data → Webhooks (HTTP POST with HMAC)
5. Sports Data → HA Integration (automation endpoints)

**External Services:**
- Weather API: Integrated in WebSocket Ingestion (15m cache)
- Carbon, Electricity, Air Quality, Calendar, Smart Meter: Internal-only (8010-8014)
- Energy Correlator, AI Automation: Internal-only (8017-8018)

### Database Architecture

**Hybrid Strategy (Epic 22):**
- **InfluxDB**: Time-series data (events, metrics, sports) - 50-500ms queries
- **SQLite**: Metadata (devices, entities, webhooks) - <10ms queries (5-10x faster)

**Benefits:**
- Optimized query performance for relational data
- Proper foreign key relationships
- ACID transactions for critical data
- Concurrent-safe (WAL mode)

## 🔍 Key Findings

### Epic 23 Enhanced Features (Documented)
1. **Automation Tracing (23.1):** Context parent_id chains for causality
2. **Spatial Analytics (23.2):** Device/area enrichment for location-based insights
3. **Duration Analytics (23.3):** Time-in-state tracking for pattern analysis
4. **Device Reliability (23.5):** Manufacturer/model metadata for reliability tracking

### Epic 12 Sports Integration (Complete)
- **Story 12.1:** InfluxDB persistence with circuit breaker
- **Story 12.2:** Historical queries (game history, timelines, schedules)
- **Story 12.3:** Webhook notifications with HMAC signatures + HA integration
- **Epic 22.3:** SQLite webhook storage for performance

### Service Counts
- **Total Services:** 17 (16 microservices + InfluxDB)
- **External Ports:** 9
- **Internal Ports:** 8
- **Database:** Hybrid (InfluxDB + SQLite)

- Data API: <10ms SQLite queries, 50-500ms InfluxDB queries

### Latency
- End-to-end event ingestion: ~80ms (HA → InfluxDB)
- Device queries: <10ms (SQLite)
- Event queries: 100-500ms (InfluxDB, depends on time range)
- Sports data: 15s cache hit <50ms, miss 200-500ms

### Caching
- Weather: 15 minutes TTL
- Sports Live: 15 seconds TTL
- Sports Upcoming: 5 minutes TTL
- API Queries: 5-15 minutes TTL

## 🔐 Security Considerations

### Authentication
- Admin API: API key required (configurable)
- Data API: API key optional (public data access)
- HA WebSocket: Long-lived access token
- Webhooks: HMAC-SHA256 signatures

### Data Protection
- Correlation IDs for distributed tracing
- Structured logging with context
- Circuit breaker patterns for resilience
- Retry logic with exponential backoff

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

1. **Hybrid Database Strategy:** SQLite for metadata provides 5-10x performance improvement over InfluxDB for relational queries

2. **HTTP Polling vs WebSockets:** Dashboard uses HTTP polling for simplicity instead of WebSockets

3. **Batch Processing:** Batching events (100/batch, 5s timeout) significantly improves throughput

4. **Epic 23 Enrichment:** Context, device, area, and duration tracking enables advanced analytics

5. **Sports Integration:** Free ESPN API + webhooks + HA integration provides complete sports automation
