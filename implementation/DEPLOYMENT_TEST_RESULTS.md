## 📈 E2E Test Attempt

### Test Configuration
- **Framework:** Playwright
- **Config:** docker-deployment.config.ts
- **Target:** Dev environment (docker-compose.dev.yml)
- **Issue:** Tests expect dev environment, but production is running

### Test Status
- **Outcome:** Did not run (environment mismatch)
- **Reason:** E2E tests require dev environment (`docker-compose.dev.yml`)
- **Current State:** Production environment running (`docker-compose.yml`)

### Recommendation
To run E2E tests, need to:
1. Stop production environment
2. Start dev environment (`docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d`)
3. Run tests: `npm test -- --config=docker-deployment.config.ts`
