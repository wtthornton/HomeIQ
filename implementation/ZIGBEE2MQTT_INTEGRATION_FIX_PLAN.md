# Zigbee2MQTT Integration Fix & Enhancement Plan

## Current Situation Analysis

### ✅ What's Working
- **Story 27.2 is COMPLETE** - Integration health checker fully implemented
- **Health detection working** - System correctly identifies Zigbee2MQTT bridge status
- **API endpoints functional** - `/api/health/integrations` returns detailed Zigbee2MQTT status

### ❌ What Needs Fixing
1. **Outdated warning message** - Dashboard shows "Check pending - will be implemented in Story 27.2" (Story 27.2 is complete)
2. **Bridge offline status** - Zigbee2MQTT bridge detected as offline
3. **Missing setup guidance** - No clear path for users to fix offline bridge
4. **Limited recovery options** - No automated recovery or troubleshooting

## Root Cause Analysis

### Dashboard Warning Issue
The warning message "Check pending - will be implemented in Story 27.2" is **outdated**. Story 27.2 is complete, but the dashboard UI hasn't been updated to reflect the new integration health checker capabilities.

### Zigbee2MQTT Bridge Offline
The integration checker is correctly detecting that the Zigbee2MQTT bridge is offline. This is a **real issue** that needs addressing:
- Bridge state: "offline" 
- Device count: 5 devices detected but bridge not responding
- Recommendation: "Check Zigbee2MQTT addon logs if offline"

## Technical Implementation Details

### Dashboard UI Updates

```typescript
// Before (outdated)
"Zigbee2MQTT integration: warning (Check pending - will be implemented in Story 27.2)"

// After (current status)
"Zigbee2MQTT integration: warning (Bridge offline - Check addon logs)"
```

### Health Checker Enhancements

```python
async def check_zigbee2mqtt_with_recovery(self) -> CheckResult:
    """Enhanced Zigbee2MQTT check with recovery options"""
    
    # Existing health check logic
    result = await self.check_zigbee2mqtt_integration()
    
    # Add recovery options if bridge is offline
    if result.status == IntegrationStatus.WARNING and "offline" in result.error_message:
        result.check_details["recovery_options"] = [
            "Restart Zigbee2MQTT addon",
            "Check MQTT broker connection", 
            "Verify coordinator connection",
            "Review addon logs"
        ]
    
    return result
```

### Setup Wizard Integration

```python
class Zigbee2MQTTSetupWizard:
    """Guided Zigbee2MQTT configuration"""
    
    async def run_setup_wizard(self):
        """Step-by-step Zigbee2MQTT setup"""
        steps = [
            self.check_prerequisites(),
            self.configure_mqtt_broker(),
            self.setup_zigbee_coordinator(),
            self.pair_devices(),
            self.optimize_network()
        ]
        
        for step in steps:
            result = await step
            if not result.success:
                return result
        
        return SetupResult(success=True)
```
