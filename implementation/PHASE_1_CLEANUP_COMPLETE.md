# Phase 1: Cleanup Complete

**Date:** 2025-01-15  
**Developer:** James (dev agent)  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

---

## Summary

Phase 1 of the Smart Meter Energy Correlation implementation is complete. All old "energy enrichment" code and documentation has been removed, preparing the codebase for the new separate time-series correlation architecture.

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Documentation Cleanup

#### `docs/architecture/database-schema.md`
**Removed:**
- Line 47: `energy_consumption` field from InfluxDB event fields
- Example in Switch Event showing `energy_consumption: 0.05`

**Rationale:** Energy data will NOT be enriched into events. It will be stored separately in `smart_meter` measurement.

#### `docs/stories/3.2.influxdb-schema-design-storage.md`
**Removed:**
- `energy_consumption` from Fields list

**Rationale:** Align story documentation with new architecture.

### 2. Code Verification

✅ **Enrichment Pipeline** - No energy enrichment code found  
✅ **WebSocket Ingestion** - No energy enrichment code found  
✅ **Data Models** - No energy fields in TypeScript/Python models

### 3. Test Scripts Verification

✅ **No test scripts to remove** - Verified these patterns:
- `test*energy*.py` - Not found
- `test*meter*.py` - Not found  
- `test*power*.py` - Not found

### 4. SQLite Schema Verification

✅ **No energy tables exist** - Verified:
- `services/data-api/src/models/device.py` - Only device metadata
- `services/data-api/src/models/entity.py` - Only entity metadata
- No energy/power/meter tables in schema
- No migrations related to energy data

**Existing SQLite Tables (Correct):**
```sql
devices:
  - device_id (PK)
  - name, manufacturer, model, sw_version
  - area_id, integration
  - last_seen, created_at

entities:
  - entity_id (PK)
  - device_id (FK → devices.device_id)
  - domain, platform, unique_id
  - area_id, disabled
  - created_at
```

---

## Architecture Confirmed

### ❌ OLD (Removed):
```python
# Events with energy enrichment
{
  "entity_id": "switch.lamp",
  "state": "on",
  "energy_consumption": 0.05  # ❌ REMOVED
}
```

### ✅ NEW (Implemented):
```python
# Events with weather enrichment ONLY
Measurement: home_assistant_events
- entity_id: switch.lamp
- state: on
- weather_temp: 18.2  # ✅ Weather still enriched

# Energy data SEPARATE
Measurement: smart_meter (to be created)
- total_power_w: 2450.0
- daily_kwh: 18.5

Measurement: smart_meter_circuit (to be created)
- circuit_name: lighting
- power_w: 450.0

Measurement: event_energy_correlation (to be created)
- entity_id: switch.lamp
- power_delta_w: +60.0
```

## Files Modified

1. `docs/architecture/database-schema.md` - Removed energy_consumption field
2. `docs/stories/3.2.influxdb-schema-design-storage.md` - Removed energy_consumption field
3. `implementation/PHASE_1_CLEANUP_COMPLETE.md` - This file (completion report)

**Total Files Modified:** 3  
**Total Lines Removed:** 3  
**Code Deletions:** 0 (no code needed removal)

---

## Verification Checklist

- [x] `energy_consumption` removed from InfluxDB schema documentation
- [x] `energy_consumption` removed from story documentation
- [x] No energy enrichment code in enrichment-pipeline
- [x] No energy enrichment code in websocket-ingestion
- [x] No energy-related test scripts to remove
- [x] No energy-related SQLite tables to remove
- [x] SQLite schema verified clean (devices + entities only)
- [x] Architecture pattern confirmed (separate storage)

---

## Next Steps

Phase 1 cleanup is complete. The codebase is now ready for Phase 2:

**Phase 2: Smart Meter Service Implementation**
- Implement Home Assistant adapter
- Configure to poll HA energy sensors
- Write data to InfluxDB `smart_meter` and `smart_meter_circuit` measurements
- 5-minute polling interval

**See:** `implementation/SMART_METER_ENERGY_CORRELATION_PLAN.md` for full implementation plan.

---

## Notes

- Weather enrichment is **preserved** - it follows the correct pattern (external context)
- Energy data will be stored **separately** - correct pattern for bi-directional causality
- SQLite schema is **clean** - no energy tables, which is correct
- No code deletions needed - system was already architected with separate services

The codebase was already well-architected with the service separation in place. Phase 1 was primarily documentation cleanup to ensure accuracy.
