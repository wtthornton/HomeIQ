## üöÄ Key Features

### **1. Multi-Turn Conversations**
Users can refine suggestions naturally:
```
User: "Flash my office lights when VGK scores"
AI: [Shows 3 suggestions]
User: "Make it 5 times instead"
AI: [Refines suggestions]
```

### **2. Context Tracking**
- Tracks mentioned devices across conversation
- Remembers active suggestions
- Passes context to backend API

### **3. Follow-up Prompts**
AI suggests what to ask next:
```
üí° Try asking:
  [Make it flash 5 times instead]
  [Use different colors for the flash]
  [Set brightness to 50%]
```

### **4. Context Indicator**
Shows active conversation state:
```
üéõÔ∏è Context: office lights ‚Ä¢ 3 active suggestions ‚Ä¢ 5 mentions
```

### **5. Conversation Persistence**
- Conversations save to localStorage
- Automatically load on page reload
- Survives browser restarts

### **6. Export/Import**
- Export conversations to JSON
- Import conversations from JSON
- Share conversations with others
- Backup your work
