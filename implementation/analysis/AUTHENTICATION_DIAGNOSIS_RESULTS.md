# 🔍 Authentication Diagnosis Results - Local Tests Complete

## ✅ **Test Results Summary:**

### **Home Assistant Connectivity:**
- ✅ **Home Assistant Server**: Accessible (HTTP 200)
- ❌ **Authentication Token**: Invalid (HTTP 401 Unauthorized)
- ❌ **API Endpoints**: All returning 401 (Unauthorized)

### **Other Services Status:**
- ✅ **Weather API**: Working perfectly (100% success rate)
- ✅ **Environment Variables**: All present and configured
- ✅ **WebSocket Service**: Healthy (but can't connect to HA)

## 🎯 **Root Cause Identified:**

The **Home Assistant token is invalid or expired**. This is causing:
- WebSocket service to fail authentication
- 0 events being processed
- Dashboard showing correct "unhealthy" status for event processing

## 🔧 **Solution Required:**

### **Step 1: Generate New Home Assistant Token**
You need to create a new Long-Lived Access Token:

1. **Open Home Assistant** in your browser: `http://192.168.1.86:8123`
2. **Go to Profile** (click your user icon in bottom left)
3. **Scroll down to "Long-Lived Access Tokens"**
4. **Click "Create Token"**
5. **Give it a name** (e.g., "HA Ingestor")
6. **Copy the generated token**

### **Step 2: Update Environment File**
Replace the current token in `.env`:
```bash
HOME_ASSISTANT_TOKEN=your_new_token_here
```

### **Step 3: Restart Services**
After updating the token:
```bash
docker-compose restart websocket-ingestion admin-api
```

## 📊 **Current Token Analysis:**
- **Current Token**: `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...`
- **Status**: Invalid/Expired
- **Expiry**: Token may have expired or been revoked
- **Permissions**: Unknown (can't test due to authentication failure)

## 🎯 **Expected Results After Fix:**
- ✅ WebSocket service will connect to Home Assistant
- ✅ Events will start flowing (dashboard will show real event counts)
- ✅ Event Processing status will change from "unhealthy" to "healthy"
- ✅ Dashboard metrics will show actual Home Assistant events

## 📋 **Next Steps:**
1. **Generate new HA token** (user action required)
2. **Update .env file** with new token
3. **Restart services** to apply changes
4. **Run tests again** to verify fix

**The system is working perfectly - it just needs a valid Home Assistant token to connect and start processing events.**
