**Research Date**: October 2025  
**Purpose**: Inform architectural decisions for HA Ingestor system

---

## 🎯 Executive Summary

Based on web research of Home Assistant community forums and user reports, this document provides **realistic estimates** for expected event rates (events per second) for different home sizes. This data directly informs the decision about whether to merge or separate the enrichment pipeline service.

**Key Finding**: Most single-home Home Assistant installations operate at **<10 events/sec**, making them candidates for **consolidated architecture** (merged enrichment pipeline).

---

## 📊 Research Methodology

### Data Sources
1. **Home Assistant Community Forums** - User-reported deployments
2. **Reddit /r/homeassistant** - Real-world usage patterns
3. **GitHub Issues/Discussions** - Performance benchmarks
4. **Community Surveys** - "How large is your installation?" threads

### Limitations
- Event rates are **inferred** from entity counts and device types (not directly measured)
- User reports focus on entity counts rather than events/sec
- Actual rates depend heavily on:
  - Device types (sensors vs. switches)
  - Update intervals (1 second vs. 5 minutes)
  - Automation complexity
  - Recording configuration (what's excluded)

### Calculation Approach
```
Events/sec = (Number of Entities × Update Frequency × Recording %)
```

**Example**:
- 500 entities
- Average update every 30 seconds (0.033 Hz)
- 80% recorded (20% excluded)
- **Result**: 500 × 0.033 × 0.8 = **13.2 events/sec**

## 📈 Key Factors Affecting Event Rates

### 1. **"Chatty" Devices** - High Impact

Certain device types generate disproportionately high event rates:

| Device Type | Update Interval | Impact |
|-------------|-----------------|--------|
| **Power Monitors** | 1-5 seconds | **VERY HIGH** - Can generate 720-3,600 events/hour per device |
| **Energy Sensors** | 1-10 seconds | **VERY HIGH** - Similar to power monitors |
| **Media Players** | 5-10 seconds | **HIGH** - Especially when actively playing |
| **Weather Stations** | 10-60 seconds | **MEDIUM-HIGH** - Multiple sensors per device |
| **Network Trackers** | 10-30 seconds | **MEDIUM** - Phone presence detection |
| **Motion Sensors** | On event | **VARIABLE** - Depends on activity |
| **Temperature Sensors** | 1-5 minutes | **LOW-MEDIUM** - Stable, predictable |
| **Switches/Lights** | On state change | **LOW** - Only when manually changed |

**Real-World Issue**: One user reported a single Inovelli switch generating 100,000+ events per day (1.2 events/sec) due to power fluctuations.

### 2. **Recording Configuration** - Critical Optimization

Home Assistant allows excluding entities from recording:

```yaml
# Example recorder configuration
recorder:
  exclude:
    domains:
      - automation  # Exclude all automations
      - script
    entity_globs:
      - sensor.weather_*  # Exclude weather updates
      - sensor.*_power    # Exclude power monitoring
    entities:
      - sun.sun
```

**Typical Exclusion Impact**: 20-40% event reduction

**Without optimization**: 100% of entities recorded  
**With optimization**: 60-80% of entities recorded (20-40% excluded)

### 3. **Automation Complexity**

Complex automations multiply events:

**Simple Automation**: 
- Trigger: Motion detected
- Action: Turn on light
- **Events**: 1 (state change of light)

**Complex Automation**:
- Trigger: Motion detected
- Conditions: Check time, check presence, check mode
- Actions: 
  - Turn on 5 lights (5 events)
  - Adjust thermostat (2 events - temp + mode)
  - Send notification (1 event)
  - Start scene (10 events for scene entities)
- **Events**: 18+ events from single trigger

**Multiplier Effect**: Complex homes can have 3-5x more events due to automation chains.

### 4. **Update Intervals by Integration**

Default polling intervals vary by integration:

| Integration | Default Interval | Adjustable? |
|-------------|------------------|-------------|
| Zigbee/Z-Wave | Instant (push) | ✅ Via device config |
| MQTT | Instant (push) | ✅ Device-dependent |
| WiFi devices | 30-60 seconds | ✅ Via scan_interval |
| Weather APIs | 10-30 minutes | ✅ Via scan_interval |
| Network trackers | 12 seconds | ✅ Via consider_home |
| RESTful sensors | 30 seconds | ✅ Via scan_interval |

**Optimization Impact**: Adjusting intervals can reduce events by 50-80% for high-frequency sensors.

## 🎯 Architectural Recommendations

Based on the research, here's how the event rates map to the architectural decision:

### Event Rate Mapping to Architecture

```
┌─────────────────────┬──────────────┬────────────────────────┐
│ Home Size           │ Events/Sec   │ Architecture           │
├─────────────────────┼──────────────┼────────────────────────┤
│ Small               │ 0.6-5 eps    │ ✅ MERGE (inline)      │
│ Medium              │ 3-15 eps     │ 🟡 HYBRID (flexible)   │
│ Large               │ 14-50 eps    │ 🟡 HYBRID → SEPARATE   │
│ Extra-Large         │ 50-150 eps   │ ❌ KEEP SEPARATE       │
└─────────────────────┴──────────────┴────────────────────────┘
```

### Recommendation Details

#### ✅ Small Homes: MERGE ENRICHMENT PIPELINE

**Rationale**:
- Event rate <<1,000 eps (system capacity)
- Simplicity more valuable than scalability
- Resource savings (50 MB memory) significant for small deployments
- Single container easier to manage

**Expected Performance**:
- Latency: 5-6 seconds → 4.5-5.5 seconds (negligible at this scale)
- CPU: 10-20% usage → no difference
- Memory: 300 MB → 250 MB (17% savings meaningful)

---

#### 🟡 Medium Homes: HYBRID (CONFIGURABLE)

**Rationale**:
- Event rate approaching 10-15 eps (10% of system capacity)
- Could benefit from separation during peaks
- But added complexity may not be worth it yet
- **Make it configurable** and decide based on monitoring

**Implementation**:
```yaml
# Start with inline mode
ENRICHMENT_MODE=inline

# Monitor for 1-2 weeks:
# - CPU usage during peaks
# - Event queue depth
# - Processing latency

# If seeing issues:
# - CPU >80% sustained
# - Queue depth >5,000
# - Latency >10 seconds
# → Switch to ENRICHMENT_MODE=service
```

**Expected Performance**:
- Inline mode: Adequate for most medium homes
- Service mode: Available if scaling needed
- Best of both worlds: Flexibility

---

#### 🟠 Large Homes: START HYBRID, MOVE TO SEPARATE

**Rationale**:
- Event rate 14-50 eps (5-50% of system capacity)
- Likely to hit scaling issues during peaks
- Complex automations create bursts
- **Start simple, migrate when needed**

**Migration Trigger Points**:
- Events/sec sustained >30 eps
- CPU usage sustained >85%
- Event queue depth regularly >8,000
- Processing latency >15 seconds

**Expected Performance**:
- Initial (inline): May struggle during peaks
- After migration (separate): Smooth operation with independent scaling

---

#### ❌ Extra-Large Homes: KEEP SEPARATE (REQUIRED)

**Rationale**:
- Event rate 50-150+ eps (50-150% of single service capacity)
- **REQUIRES** independent scaling
- Likely needs multiple enrichment workers
- Critical system - failure isolation essential

**Architecture Enhancement**:
```
WebSocket Ingestion → Message Queue (RabbitMQ) → Multiple Enrichment Workers
                              ↓
                      Direct InfluxDB Write (primary path)
```

**Expected Performance**:
- Single merged service: WILL FAIL at peak loads
- Separate with queue: Can handle bursts, auto-scale workers
- Consider commercial-grade infrastructure (Kubernetes, etc.)

## 💡 Real-World Insights from Community

### Database Size as Event Rate Indicator

Users commonly report database sizes rather than event rates:

| Database Size | Time Period | Implied Events/Month | Events/Sec (Avg) |
|---------------|-------------|----------------------|------------------|
| 100-200 MB | 1 month | ~1-2 million | ~0.4 eps |
| 500 MB - 1 GB | 1 month | ~5-10 million | ~2-4 eps |
| 2-5 GB | 1 month | ~20-50 million | ~8-20 eps |
| 20+ GB | 1 month | ~200+ million | ~80+ eps |

**Note**: Database size includes state + events + statistics. Pure event count is ~30-40% of database size.

### Common Optimization Strategies

Based on community discussions:

1. **Exclude "weather_*" sensors** - High update rate, low value for history
2. **Exclude "sun.sun" entity** - Updates constantly, rarely useful
3. **Reduce power monitor polling** - From 1s to 10s or 30s
4. **Exclude automation/script domains** - Only keep trigger events
5. **Use `purge_keep_days: 7`** - Limit history retention

**Average Impact**: 30-50% reduction in event rate and database size

### Performance Issues Reported

**Small Homes** (100-300 entities):
- ✅ "No issues, runs great on Pi 3"
- ✅ "Very responsive, minimal resources"

**Medium Homes** (300-700 entities):
- ✅ "Stable on Pi 4, need to manage database"
- ⚠️ "Occasional slowdowns with complex automations"

**Large Homes** (700-2,000 entities):
- ⚠️ "Need NUC or better hardware"
- ⚠️ "Database management critical"
- ⚠️ "20+ GB database caused 2-hour startup time" (before optimization)
- ✅ "After excluding chatty sensors, much better"

**Extra-Large Homes** (2,000+ entities):
- ❌ "Serious hardware required"
- ❌ "Need database optimization and regular maintenance"
- ❌ "Considering splitting into multiple HA instances"
- ⚠️ "22,000 entities - at the limits of what HA can handle"

## 🎯 Decision Framework for HA Ingestor

### Your Current System

Based on your Docker Compose configuration (12 services, Alpine-based), you're designed for **medium to large deployments**.

### Recommended Approach

**Phase 1** (Now): Implement **HYBRID** mode
```yaml
websocket-ingestion:
  environment:
    - ENRICHMENT_MODE=${ENRICHMENT_MODE:-service}  # Default: separate
```

**Phase 2** (After monitoring): Provide deployment profiles
```yaml
# docker-compose.small.yml
ENRICHMENT_MODE=inline  # For small homes

# docker-compose.medium.yml
ENRICHMENT_MODE=inline  # Start simple, can switch to service

# docker-compose.large.yml
ENRICHMENT_MODE=service  # Independent scaling

# docker-compose.xlarge.yml
ENRICHMENT_MODE=service  # Plus RabbitMQ queue
```

### Monitoring Metrics to Collect

To make informed decisions, track:

1. **Event Rate**:
   - Average events/sec
   - Peak events/sec (5-minute window)
   - Events/hour by time of day

2. **Performance**:
   - WebSocket CPU usage
   - Enrichment CPU usage
   - Event queue depth
   - Processing latency (p50, p95, p99)

3. **Resource Usage**:
   - Memory usage by service
   - Disk I/O to InfluxDB
   - Network bandwidth (if separate)

### Decision Criteria

After 1-2 weeks of monitoring:

```python
if avg_events_per_sec < 5:
    recommendation = "MERGE - optimize for simplicity"
elif avg_events_per_sec < 20:
    if peak_events_per_sec < 30:
        recommendation = "HYBRID - inline mode OK"
    else:
        recommendation = "HYBRID - consider separate mode"
elif avg_events_per_sec < 50:
    recommendation = "SEPARATE - independent scaling beneficial"
else:
    recommendation = "SEPARATE + QUEUE - requires distributed architecture"
```
