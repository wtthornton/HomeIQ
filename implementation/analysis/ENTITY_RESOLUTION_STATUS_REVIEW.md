# Entity Resolution Status Review

**Date:** October 29, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Major Improvements Complete, ‚ö†Ô∏è Final Testing Pending  
**Focus:** Numbered Device Mapping & Location-Aware Entity Resolution

---

## üéØ Executive Summary

**What We've Accomplished:**
- ‚úÖ Implemented full model chain (NER + Embeddings + Hybrid Scoring)
- ‚úÖ Added location-aware entity resolution (95% penalty for location mismatches)
- ‚úÖ Enhanced numbered device detection and matching
- ‚úÖ Removed group entity fallback (per your request - now handled on system cleanup page)

**Current State:**
- ‚úÖ "Office light 1" ‚Üí `light.hue_color_downlight_1_6` ‚úÖ CORRECT
- ‚úÖ "Office light 2" ‚Üí `light.hue_color_downlight_2_2` ‚úÖ CORRECT
- ‚ö†Ô∏è "Office light 3" ‚Üí `light.hue_color_downlight_2_2` ‚ùå STILL WRONG
- ‚ö†Ô∏è "Office light 4" ‚Üí `light.hue_color_downlight_2_2` ‚ùå STILL WRONG

**Root Cause (Confirmed):**
- Lights 3 & 4 exist as `light.hue_color_downlight_3` and `light.hue_color_downlight_4`
- BUT they're in **master_bedroom**, not office
- Location mismatch penalty may not be triggering (confidence might still be > 0.3)

## üìã What Has Been Implemented

### 1. Full Model Chain Entity Resolution ‚úÖ

**Components:**
- **NER Extraction**: HuggingFace transformer-based named entity recognition
- **Entity Enrichment**: Fetches device metadata (name, manufacturer, model, area_id)
- **Embedding Matching**: Sentence-transformers semantic similarity (all-MiniLM-L6-v2)
- **Hybrid Scoring System**:
  - Embedding similarity (40%)
  - Exact name matches (30%)
  - Numbered device matching (20%)
  - Location matching (10%)

**Location**: `services/ai-automation-service/src/services/entity_validator.py`

### 2. Location-Aware Matching ‚úÖ

**Features:**
- Extracts location from query ("office", "kitchen", etc.)
- Filters entities by `entity_area_id` and `device_area_id`
- Heavy penalty (√ó0.05) for location mismatches
- Enhanced location detection in entity_id, friendly_name, device_name

**Code**: Lines 904-957 in `entity_validator.py`

### 3. Group Entity Detection ‚úÖ

**Purpose**: Penalize group entities when numbered811 device requested
- Detects group entities (e.g., `light.office`)
- Heavily penalizes (√ó0.1) when numbered query requests individual device

**Code**: Lines 1038-1089 in `entity_validator.py`

### 4. Confidence Threshold ‚úÖ

**Behavior**:
- For numbered queries: Only map if confidence ‚â• 0.3
- Low confidence ‚Üí Skip mapping, log warning
- Missing entities ‚Üí Address on system cleanup page

**Code**: Lines 404-418 in `entity_validator.py`

## üîç Current Issue Analysis

### Test Results (Latest Run)

```json
{
  "validated_entities": {
    "Office light 1": "light.hue_color_downlight_1_6",  ‚úÖ CORRECT
    "Office light 2": "light.hue_color_downlight_2_2",  ‚úÖ CORRECT
    "Office light 3": "light.hue_color_downlight_2_2",  ‚ùå WRONG (should be no match)
    "Office light 4": "light.hue_color_downlight_2_2"   ‚ùå WRONG (should be no match)
  }
}
```

### What Should Happen

For "Office light 3" and "Office light 4":
1. System finds `light.hue_color_downlight_3` and `light.hue_color_downlight_4`
2. Detects these are in **master_bedroom** (not office)
3. Applies location mismatch penalty (√ó0.05)
4. Confidence drops below 0.3 threshold
5. **Should skip mapping** (return no match)
6. Log warning: "will be addressed on system cleanup page"

### Why It's Still Matching

**Hypothesis 1: Location penalty not strong enough**
- Current penalty: √ó0.05 (95% reduction)
- Even with penalty, confidence might still be > 0.3
- **Action**: Review scoring weights, ensure location mismatch drops confidence below threshold

**Hypothesis 2: Location not being detected correctly**
- Device area_id might not be populated in enrichment
- Location context might not be extracted from query properly
- **Action**: Verify enrichment pipeline populates `device_area_id`

**Hypothesis 3: Scoring logic issue**
- Location penalty applied after other scores
- Base score might be high enough that even with penalty, it's > 0.3
- **Action**: Apply location penalty earlier in scoring chain

---

## üéØ Options for Next Steps

### Option 1: Debug Current Implementation (RECOMMENDED) ‚≠ê

**Goal**: Understand why location mismatch penalty isn't preventing matches

**Actions**:
1. Add detailed logging to see:
   - What entities are being considered
   - What their scores are before/after location penalty
   - What their `device_area_id` values are
   - Final confidence calculations
2. Run test with DEBUG logging
3. Analyze why confidence remains > 0.3 for lights 3 & 4

**Time**: ~30 minutes
**Risk**: Low
**Benefit**: Understand root cause, fix properly

---

### Option 2: Strengthen Location Penalty

**Goal**: Make location mismatch penalty more aggressive

**Actions**:
1. Increase penalty from √ó0.05 to √ó0.01 (99% reduction)
2. Or: Set confidence to 0.0 directly when location mismatch detected
3. Or: Filter out location mismatches entirely (don't even consider them)

**Time**: ~15 minutes
**Risk**: Medium (might be too aggressive, reject valid matches)
**Benefit**: Quick fix, likely to solve immediate issue

---

### Option 3: Add Explicit Location Filter

**Goal**: Pre-filter candidates by location before scoring

**Actions**:
1. Before scoring, filter out entities not in specified location
2. Only score candidates that match location
3. If no candidates in location, return no match

**Time**: ~30 minutes
**Risk**: Low
**Benefit**: Clean separation of concerns, more predictable behavior

---

### Option 4: Accept Current Behavior for Now

**Goal**: Move forward with other features, address later

**Actions**:
1. Document known limitation
2. Add to system cleanup page backlog
3. Continue with other improvements

**Time**: ~5 minutes
**Risk**: Low
**Benefit**: Don't block other work

## ü§î Questions for Discussion

### 1. Location Mismatch Handling
**Question**: What should happen when a numbered device exists but in wrong location?

**Current**: Apply penalty, if confidence < 0.3, skip mapping  
**Alternative**: Always skip if location mismatch (even without scoring)

**Your Preference**: ?

### 2. Confidence Threshold
**Question**: Is 0.3 the right threshold for numbered devices?

**Current**: 0.3 (30%)  
**Options**: 
- Lower (0.2 = 20%) - More strict
- Higher (0.5 = 50%) - Less strict
- Dynamic based on query complexity

**Your Preference**: ?

### 3. System Cleanup Page
**Question**: What should the system cleanup page show for missing entities?

**Current**: Logs warning "will be addressed on system cleanup page"  
**Needs**:
- UI to show unmapped entities
- Suggestions for fixing (rename entities, create aliases, etc.)
- Integration with entity renaming (from ENTITY_CLEANUP_RENAMING_DISCUSSION.md)

**Your Preference**: ?

### 4. Priority of Next Steps
**Question**: Which option should we pursue?

**Recommendation**: Option 1 (Debug) to understand root cause  
**Alternative**: Option 3 (Explicit Filter) for cleanest solution

**Your Preference**: ?

## üìù Recommendation

**My Recommendation**: **Option 1 - Debug Current Implementation**

**Why**:
1. We've invested significant effort in full model chain
2. Location penalty logic is in place but may not be triggering correctly
3. Understanding root cause will help us fix it properly
4. Prevents future similar issues

**What I'll Do**:
1. Add comprehensive DEBUG logging
2. Run test to capture scoring details
3. Identify why confidence > 0.3 despite location mismatch
4. Fix the specific issue
5. Verify lights 3 & 4 correctly return no match

**Time Estimate**: 30-45 minutes
