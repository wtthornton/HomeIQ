- Suggestion simplification works correctly
- Test endpoint can execute HA Conversation API commands
- Users see success/error feedback

## Next Steps for User

### Manual Testing

1. Open Health Dashboard (http://localhost:3000)
2. Navigate to Ask AI page
3. Submit a query (e.g., "Flash the office lights every 30 secs")
4. Wait for suggestions to appear
5. Click "Test" button on any suggestion
6. Verify:
   - âœ… Loading toast appears
   - âœ… Success toast appears with execution result
   - âœ… No errors in browser console

### Expected Test Button Behavior

When clicking Test, the following happens:

1. **API Call:** `POST /api/v1/ask-ai/query/{query_id}/suggestions/{suggestion_id}/test`
2. **Backend Processing:**
   - Fetches query from database
   - Finds specific suggestion
   - Simplifies suggestion using OpenAI
   - Executes command via HA Conversation API
3. **Response:**
   - Returns execution result
   - Shows success/error message
4. **Frontend:**
   - Displays success toast
   - Shows automation ID if successful
