## 🎯 Current State Analysis

### **Suggestion Generation Flow (Current)**

```
User Query
    ↓
Entity Extraction (Multi-signal matching: 35% embeddings, 30% exact, 15% fuzzy, 15% numbered, 5% location)
    ↓
OpenAI GPT-4o-mini Prompt (description-only generation)
    ↓
3 Suggestions Returned (confidence scores, device capabilities, trigger/action summaries)
    ↓
User Sees: Description cards
```

**Current Strengths:**
- ✅ Entity resolution with multi-signal matching (90-95% accuracy)
- ✅ Device capability enrichment (Zigbee2MQTT expose data)
- ✅ User alias support
- ✅ Description-first flow (no YAML until approval)

**Current Limitations:**
- ⚠️ Suggestions lack historical usage context
- ⚠️ No ML pattern matching to similar automations
- ⚠️ Limited HA YAML optimization hints in prompts
- ⚠️ Doesn't leverage existing automation patterns from HA instance

---

### **Test Stage Flow (Current)**

```
User Clicks "Test"
    ↓
Simplify suggestion description (OpenAI GPT-4o-mini)
    ↓
Strip timing/delays/repeats for test
    ↓
Generate minimal YAML (event trigger, immediate action)
    ↓
Create temporary automation in HA
    ↓
Trigger immediately
    ↓
Wait 30 seconds
    ↓
Delete automation
```

**Current Strengths:**
- ✅ Quick execution without permanent automations
- ✅ Entity validation occurs
- ✅ Quality report generated

**Current Limitations:**
- ⚠️ Doesn't capture device state before/after
- ⚠️ No validation that action actually executed
- ⚠️ Limited feedback on what was stripped out
- ⚠️ Doesn't test complex sequences (only immediate actions)

---

### **Accept Stage Flow (Current)**

```
User Clicks "Approve"
    ↓
Generate full YAML using original suggestion (not test version)
    ↓
Validate YAML syntax
    ↓
Create automation in HA
    ↓
Return automation_id
```

**Current Strengths:**
- ✅ Full YAML generation with all features
- ✅ Entity validation with capabilities
- ✅ Direct HA automation creation

**Current Limitations:**
- ⚠️ Doesn't explicitly restore timing/delays/repeats removed for test
- ⚠️ No optimization based on test results
- ⚠️ Doesn't use HA YAML best practices from existing automations
- ⚠️ Missing advanced HA features (parallel, choose, scene, script integration)

    # For each term, find fuzzy matches above threshold
    fuzzy_expansions = {}
    for term in query_terms:
        matches = process.extract(
            term,
            [d['friendly_name'] for d in all_devices],
            limit=3,
            score_cutoff=70  # 70% similarity threshold
        )
        if matches:
            fuzzy_expansions[term] = [m[0] for m in matches]
    
    # Enhance suggestion prompt with fuzzy matches
    prompt = f"""

    # "Flash 5 times" → Flash 2 times (faster preview)
    
    return await execute_test(test_yaml)
```

**Use Case:**
```
Original: "Flash lights 5 times with 2-second delays, then turn off"
Test: "Flash lights 2 times with 0.2-second delays, then turn off"
      (Same pattern, 10x faster for quick preview)
```

    """WebSocket stream of state changes during test"""
    
    # Connect to HA WebSocket
    async with ha_websocket() as ws:
        # Subscribe to entity state changes
        await ws.subscribe_states(entities)
        
        # Stream updates to frontend
        async for state_update in ws.receive():
            yield {
                "entity_id": state_update['entity_id'],
                "new_state": state_update['new_state'],
                "timestamp": state_update['timestamp']
            }
```

**UI Enhancement:**
```
🧪 Testing in progress...

light.office: ⚪ off → 🔵 on (brightness 230, blue)

async def generate_accept_yaml(suggestion, test_results):
    """Generate full YAML with components restored from test"""
    
    # Get original suggestion (not test version)
    original = suggestion
    
    # Get what was stripped for test
    stripped = analyze_stripped_components(original)
    
    # Generate YAML with explicit restoration
    yaml = await generate_automation_yaml(
        suggestion=original,
        restore_stripped=True,
        stripped_components=stripped
    )
    
    # Add comment in YAML explaining restored components
    yaml_with_comments = add_restoration_comments(yaml, stripped)
    
    return yaml_with_comments
```

**YAML Output:**
```yaml
alias: "Office Light Flash on VGK Goal"
description: "Flash office lights when VGK scores"

# RESTORED FOR PRODUCTION:
# - Timing: Re("-occurring every 30 seconds (removed for test)
# - Delays: 2-second delays between flashes (removed for test)
# - Repeats: 5 flash cycles (tested with 1 cycle)

trigger:
  - platform: state
    entity_id: input_number.vgk_score
    attribute: value

action:
  - repeat:
      count: 5  # RESTORED: Was 1 in test
      sequence:
        - service: light.turn_on
          target:
            entity_id: light.office
          data:
            brightness_pct: 100
            color_name: blue
        - delay: "00:00:02"  # RESTORED: Was removed in test
        
condition:
  - condition: time
    after: "18:00:00"  # RESTORED: Evening-only condition
```

**Metrics:**
- **Target:** 100% of stripped components restored in accept stage

    # If test showed device responded slowly, add delays
    if test_results-average_response_time > 1.0:
        optimizations.append({
            "type": "add_delay",
            "reason": "Device responded slowly in test (1.2s avg)",
            "action": "Add 0.5s delay after trigger"
        })
    
    # If test showed brightness was too high/low, adjust
    if test_results.brightness_feedback:
        optimizations.append({
            "type": "adjust_brightness",
            "reason": f"User feedback: {test_results.brightness_feedback}",
            "action": "Adjust brightness_pct from 100 to 75"
        })
    
    # Generate optimized YAML
    return generate_yaml_with_optimizations(suggestion, optimizations)
```

**Prompt Enhancement:**
```python
TEST RESULTS ANALYSIS:
- Device response time: 1.2s average (consider adding 0.5s delay)
- Brightness: User feedback "too bright" (reduce from 100% to 75%)
- Color: Tested blue, user approved (keep blue)

OPTIMIZATION RECOMMENDATIONS:

        response_format={"type": "json_object"},  # Force JSON mode
        max_tokens=500
    )
    
    # Guaranteed valid JSON (no parsing errors)
    analysis = json.loads(response.choices[0].message.content)
    
    return {
        "execution_status": analysis['execution_status'],
        "state_changes": analysis['state_changes'],
        "stripped_components": analysis['stripped_components'],
