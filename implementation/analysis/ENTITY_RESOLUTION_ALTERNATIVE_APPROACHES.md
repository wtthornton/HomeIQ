# Entity Resolution: Alternative Approaches and Industry Solutions

**Date:** October 29, 2025  
**Purpose:** Research on how other systems solve entity resolution for smart homes and natural language queries

---

## Executive Summary

This document compares our Full Model Chain Architecture with alternative approaches used by industry players, research communities, and open-source projects. While our hybrid approach (embeddings + exact matching + numbered matching + location) is comprehensive, other solutions focus on different aspects of the problem.

**Key Finding:** Most successful systems combine multiple techniques, but prioritize different cast signals based on their use case (voice assistants vs. programmatic matching vs. conversational AI).

---

## 1. Industry Voice Assistants

### Amazon Alexa / Google Home

**Approach:** Intent-based classification with device discovery + slot filling

**How It Works:**
1. **Device Discovery Phase**: Alexa/Google discover devices via Smart Home APIs (Alexa Skills, Google Home APIs)
2. **User Registration**: Users explicitly name devices during setup ("This is the kitchen light")
3. **Intent Classification**: NLU engine classifies intent ("turn on", "dim", "set temperature")
4. **Slot Filling**: Extracts entities from voice command ("kitchen light" → device slot)
5. **Exact Name Matching**: Matches slots against registered device names
6. **Confirmation**: Asks user for clarification if ambiguous ("Did you mean Kitchen Light or Kitchen Lamp?")

**Key Differences from Our Approach:**
- ✅ **Explicit device naming**: Users register names upfront (no ambiguity)
- ✅ **Simpler matching**: Exact name match against user-registered names
- ❌ **Less flexible**: Requires user setup before using
- ❌ **No semantic matching**: "lamp" won't match "light" unless user registered both
- ✅ **Confirmation dialogs**: Fallback to asking user when ambiguous

**Tools/Technologies:**
- Alexa: Apache OpenNLP, Intent Classification models
- Google: Dialogflow, Entity Extraction APIs
- Pattern: Intent → Entity Extraction → Name Matching → API Call

**Applicable to Us:**
- Add confirmation dialog for low-confidence matches
- Consider user-defined aliases/nicknames for devices
- Use intent classification to narrow entity search space

### Apple HomeKit / Siri

**Approach:** Structured device metadata + voice command templates

**How It Works:**
1. **Device Metadata**: Devices expose structured metadata (name, room, device type, capabilities)
2. **Room/Zone Mapping**: Siri uses room assignments ("Bedroom", "Kitchen") to filter
3. **Template Matching**: Voice commands mapped to device templates ("turn on [device] in [room]")
4. **Exact Matching**: Matches against friendly names in room context
5. **Device Type Filtering**: Filters by capability (lights, switches, thermostats)

**Key Differences:**
- ✅ **Strong room context**: Room filtering happens early
- ✅ **Capability-based**: Filters by device type/capability
- ❌ **No fuzzy matching**: Exact name matching only
- ❌ **Requires strict room assignment**: All devices must be in rooms

**Applicable to Us:**
- Already using room/area filtering (similar approach)
- Could improve room extraction from queries
- Consider capability filtering (lights vs switches)

## 5. Alternative Techniques We Could Adopt

### 5.1 Intent Classification

**What:** Classify user intent before entity matching

**How It Works:**
```
Query: "Turn on Office light 1"
  ↓
Intent Classification:
  - Intent: "turn_on"
  - Domain: "light"
  ↓
Entity Matching:
  - Only search light entities
  - Faster, more accurate
```

**Benefits:**
- Reduces search space (only light entities if intent is "turn_on")
- Improves accuracy (eliminates irrelevant domains)
- Better error messages ("No lights found" vs "No entities found")

**Implementation:**
- Use pre-trained intent classifier (e.g., spaCy, Rasa)
- Or train simple keyword-based classifier
- Could integrate with our existing OpenAI queries

**Comparison:**
- ✅ Home Assistant conversational agent does this
- ✅ Alexa/Google do intent classification first
- ❌ We are not currently doing intent classification
- ✅ Would improve our entity matching speed and accuracy

---

### 5.2 User-Defined Aliases

**What:** Allow users to define nicknames/aliases for devices

**How It Works:**
```
Device: light.hue_go_1
Aliases: ["office light 1", "office front left", "desk light"]
  ↓
Query: "Turn on desk light"
  ↓
Matches alias → maps to light.hue_go_1
```

**Benefits:**
- Handles user-specific terminology
- No ambiguity if alias is unique
- User feels more control

**Implementation:**
- Store aliases in database/metadata
- Match aliases during entity resolution
- Allow users to set aliases via UI

**Comparison:**
- ✅ Alexa/Google allow device nicknames
- ✅ Simple to implement
- ✅ Complements our Full Model Chain (alias check before ML)

---

### 5.3 Fuzzy String Matching

**What:** String similarity algorithms (Levenshtein, Jaro-Winkler)

**How It Works:**
```
Query: "office lite 1"  (typo)
Entity: "Office Light 1"

Levenshtein distance: 1 (1 character difference)
Similarity: 0.95 (very similar)
  ↓
Match with high confidence
```

**Benefits:**
- Handles typos
- Handles abbreviations ("LR light" → "Living Room Light")
- Fast computation

**Implementation:**
- Use `fuzzywuzzy` or `rapidfuzz` libraries
- Calculate similarity scores
- Can combine with embeddings

**Comparison:**
- ✅ Home Assistant uses Levenshtein distance

- ✅ Could supplement our exact matching signal

---

### 5.4 Blocking/Indexing

**What:** Reduce candidate space before detailed matching

**How It Works:**
```
All Entities: 10,000 entities
  ↓
Block by Domain: light entities only → 500 entities quota
  ↓
Block by Area: office area only → 50 entities
  ↓
Detailed Matching: Compare against 50 candidates (fast!)
```

**Benefits:**
- Dramatically reduces computation
- Faster matching for large entity lists
- Can use multiple blocking keys

**Implementation:**
- Index entities by domain, area_id, device_type
- Filter candidates before embedding matching
- Currently doing this with area filtering, could improve

**Comparison:**

- ✅ Used by enterprise ER tools (Splink, Zingg)
- ✅ Would speed up our matching significantly

---

### 5.5 Active Learning / User Feedback

**What:** Learn from user corrections to improve matching

**How It Works:**
```
System: "Did you mean light.hue_go_1?"
User: "No, I meant light.garage_2"
  ↓
System learns:
  - Query: "Office light 1"
  - Wrong match: light.hue_go_1
  - Correct match: light.garage_2
  ↓
Future queries: Adjusts scoring based on feedback
```

**Benefits:**
- Improves accuracy over time
- Personalizes to user's terminology
- Reduces errors on repeat queries

**Implementation:**
- Store user feedback in database

- ❌ Requires feedback loop infrastructure

---

### 5.6 Context-Aware Entity Resolution

**What:** Use conversation history/context to disambiguate

**How It Works:**
```
Previous: "Turn on the office lights"
Current: "Turn them off"
  ↓
Context: "them" refers to office lights from previous query
  ↓
Matches: light.office (group entity)
```

**Benefits:**
- Handles pronouns ("it", "them")
- Handles ellipsis ("turn it off")
- More natural conversation

**Implementation:**
- Store conversation context (last N queries)
- Track entity references
- Resolve pronouns using context

**Comparison:**
- ✅ Alexa/Google maintain conversation context
