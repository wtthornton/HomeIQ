## 🚀 HOW TO REVIEW

### Step 1: Open Dashboard (30 seconds)
```
http://localhost:3000
```

**You should see:**
- 13 tabs at top
- "🤖 AI Automations" tab (click it)

---

### Step 2: Test Natural Language Generation (2 minutes)

**In the AI Automations tab:**

1. **Find the blue box at top** titled "✨ Create Automation from Natural Language"

2. **Type this request:**
   ```
   Turn on kitchen light at 7 AM on weekdays
   ```

3. **Click:** "Generate Automation"

4. **Wait:** 3-5 seconds (calling OpenAI)

5. **Review:** Generated automation appears in list below with:
   - Title, description, confidence score
   - Click "▶ View Automation YAML" to see generated code
   - Safety score displayed

---

### Step 3: Test Safety Validation (2 minutes)

**Try a SAFE automation:**
```
Turn on kitchen light at 7 AM
```
- Click "Generate"
- Then click "✅ Approve & Deploy"
- **Should succeed** with safety score ~95-100

**Try an UNSAFE automation:**
```
Turn off all devices and restart Home Assistant
```
- Click "Generate"
- Then click "✅ Approve & Deploy"
- **Should fail** with safety validation error showing issues

---

### Step 4: Check Home Assistant (1 minute)

**After approving a safe automation:**

1. Open your Home Assistant: `http://192.168.1.86:8123`
2. Go to: Settings → Automations & Scenes
3. **Look for:** New automation (e.g., "Morning Kitchen Light")
4. **Verify:** It exists in HA!

---

### Step 5: Test Rollback (1 minute)

**If you deployed an automation:**

1. In AI Automations tab, change filter to "Deployed"
2. Find your deployed automation
3. Click "⏪ Rollback to Previous Version"
4. Enter reason: "Testing rollback"
5. **Verify:** Success message
6. **Check HA:** Automation should be back to previous state

---

## 📊 What to Look For

### ✅ Should Work
- NL input generates valid YAML
- Safety validation shows scores
- Approve button deploys to HA
- Rollback restores previous version
- Status filters work (Pending/Approved/Deployed/Rejected)
- Dark mode toggle works
- Mobile responsive (if testing on phone)

### ⚠️ Might See (Expected)
- MQTT connection errors in logs (not critical - just for notifications)
- First OpenAI call might be slower (~5s)
- Some generated automations might need clarification

### ❌ Should NOT See
- Service crashes
- Database errors
- Infinite loading states
- Blank screens
- HA crashes when deploying automation

```
https://platform.openai.com/usage
```

**Expected for 5-10 test requests:**
- Total cost: $0.10 - $0.30
- Model: gpt-4o-mini
- Tokens: ~800 per request

---

## 📝 What to Note During Review

### Please Track
1. **NL Generation Quality:**
   - How many requests worked on first try?
   - Did any generate invalid YAML?
   - Were device names correct?

2. **Safety Validation:**
   - Did it block genuinely unsafe automations?
   - Any false positives (blocked safe automation)?
   - Are safety scores reasonable?

3. **User Experience:**
   - Is UI intuitive?
   - Response times acceptable?
   - Error messages clear?

4. **Rollback:**
   - Did it work smoothly?
   - Was previous version restored correctly in HA?

## 🐛 If Something Doesn't Work

### Dashboard Won't Load
```bash
docker-compose logs health-dashboard --tail=50
```

### AI Service Issues
```bash
docker-compose logs ai-automation-service --tail=50
```

### Can't Generate Automations
- Check OpenAI API key is valid
- Check you have API credits
- Look for errors in ai-automation-service logs

### Can't Deploy to HA
- Verify HA is accessible at configured URL
- Check HA_TOKEN is valid (not expired)
- Look in HA logs for errors

---

## 📊 Quick Verification Commands

**Test AI Service Health:**
```powershell
curl http://localhost:8018/health
```

**Test NL Generation (API):**
```powershell
$body = @{
  request_text = "Turn on kitchen light at 7 AM"
  user_id = "default"
} | ConvertTo-Json

Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:8018/api/nl/generate" `
  -Method POST `
  -ContentType "application/json" `
  -Body $body
```

**Check OpenAI Integration:**
```powershell
curl http://localhost:8018/api/nl/examples
```
