## ✅ Verification Steps

### 1. Access Dashboard
**URL:** http://localhost:3000/

### 2. Check Tab Count
You should now see **11 tabs** instead of 12:
1. 📊 Overview
2. 🔧 Services
3. 🔗 Dependencies
4. 📱 Devices
5. 📡 Events
6. 📜 Logs
7. 🏈 Sports
8. 🌐 Data Sources
9. 📈 Analytics
10. 🚨 Alerts
11. ⚙️ Configuration

**Missing:** 🎨 Custom (removed)

### 3. Check Console (DevTools)
On first load, you should see:
```
✅ Cleaned up deprecated Custom tab layout from localStorage
```

### 4. Check localStorage (DevTools → Application)
- ❌ `dashboard-layout` key should be **removed**
- ✅ `dashboard-layout-cleanup-v1` = "true" should be **present**

### 5. Test Navigation
- ✅ All remaining tabs should work normally
- ✅ Tab switching should be smooth
- ✅ No console errors
- ✅ All data should load correctly

## 🔍 Post-Deployment Checks

### Automatic Checks (Already Verified)
- ✅ Container build successful
- ✅ Container started and healthy
- ✅ Nginx worker processes running (48)
- ✅ Health check endpoint responding (200 OK)
- ✅ HTTP server accessible

### Manual Checks (For You to Verify)
1. **Open http://localhost:3000/**
   - Should load without errors
   - Should show 11 tabs (not 12)
   - No Custom tab visible

2. **Check Browser Console**
   - Should see localStorage cleanup message (first load only)
   - No JavaScript errors
   - No missing component warnings

3. **Test Each Tab**
   - Overview → Should load normally
   - Services → Should show all services
   - Dependencies → Should show dependency graph
   - Devices → Should show device list
   - Events → Should stream events
   - Logs → Should show logs
   - Sports → Should show sports data
   - Data Sources → Should show sources
   - Analytics → Should show analytics
   - Alerts → Should show alerts
   - Configuration → Should show config

4. **Check Browser Storage**
   - DevTools → Application → Local Storage
   - Should NOT see `dashboard-layout`
   - Should see `dashboard-layout-cleanup-v1`

## 🛠️ Rollback Plan (If Needed)

If you encounter any issues, you can rollback:

```bash
# Rollback to previous image (if you have it)
docker-compose down health-dashboard
# Edit code to restore Custom tab
# Rebuild and restart
docker-compose build health-dashboard
docker-compose up -d health-dashboard
```

**Note:** Rollback should not be necessary - all changes were non-breaking.

## 📞 Troubleshooting

### If Dashboard Doesn't Load
1. Check container logs: `docker logs ha-ingestor-dashboard`
2. Check container status: `docker ps --filter "name=dashboard"`
3. Restart container: `docker-compose restart health-dashboard`

### If You See Errors in Console
1. Hard refresh: `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Windows) or `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac)
2. Clear browser cache for localhost:3000
3. Clear localStorage: DevTools → Application → Clear Storage

### If localStorage Cleanup Doesn't Work
1. Manually delete `dashboard-layout` key in DevTools
2. Refresh page
3. Check for cleanup message in console

---

## 📝 Next Steps

1. **Test the Dashboard** - Visit http://localhost:3000/
2. **Verify All Tabs** - Make sure all 11 tabs work correctly
3. **Check Console** - Look for the cleanup success message
4. **Clear Cache** - If you see the old 12-tab version, hard refresh
