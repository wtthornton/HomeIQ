## What Was Done

### 1. Root Cause Analysis
- Discovered two competing sports services (sports-api + sports-data)
- Identified missing nginx routing as the root cause
- Analyzed which service to keep based on cost, features, and frontend integration

### 2. Implementation (Option 1)
- ✅ Fixed nginx.conf routing for `/api/sports/`
- ✅ Archived sports-api service in docker-compose.yml
- ✅ Updated tech stack documentation
- ✅ Marked Epic 10 as archived with restoration guide
- ✅ Created comprehensive verification guide
- ✅ Deployed and verified all changes

### 3. Testing & Verification
- ✅ 6/6 verification tests passed
- ✅ NHL teams API working (200 OK)
- ✅ Live games API working (200 OK)
- ✅ Nginx routing verified in container
- ✅ sports-api confirmed not running
- ✅ Overall system healthy

## 🎯 Problems Solved

| Problem | Solution | Status |
|---------|----------|--------|
| NHL data not working in production | Fixed nginx routing to sports-data | ✅ SOLVED |
| Dual sports services confusion | Archived sports-api, kept sports-data | ✅ SOLVED |
| Unclear architecture | Documented single-service approach | ✅ SOLVED |
| Potential API costs | Eliminated need for paid API key | ✅ SOLVED |

## 🔧 Architecture Changes

### Before
```
Frontend → /api/sports/teams
    ↓
Nginx → /api/ → admin-api ❌ (404 Not Found)

Active Services:
- sports-api (8015) - Not connected
- sports-data (8005) - Connected but broken routing
```

### After
```
Frontend → /api/sports/teams
    ↓
Nginx → /api/sports/ → sports-data:8005 ✅ (200 OK)

Active Services:
- sports-data (8005) - Connected with working routing
```

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Week 1 (Critical)
- [ ] Monitor sports-data logs daily
- [ ] Test Sports tab with real users
- [ ] Check API usage (<50 calls/day expected)
- [ ] Verify cache hit rate (>80% expected)
- [ ] Gather user feedback

### Month 1 (Important)
- [ ] Review performance metrics
- [ ] Complete NHL/NFL team lists
- [ ] Consider fixing sports-data health check
- [ ] Evaluate if advanced features needed

### Future (Optional)
- [ ] Restore sports-api if advanced features requested
- [ ] Add Redis for distributed caching
- [ ] Implement WebSocket for real-time updates
- [ ] Add more sports (MLB, NBA, MLS)

---

## 🔄 Rollback Procedure (If Needed)

**If issues occur, rollback is simple:**

```bash
# Option 1: Restore previous nginx.conf
git checkout HEAD~1 services/health-dashboard/nginx.conf
docker-compose build health-dashboard
docker-compose up -d health-dashboard

# Option 2: Restore sports-api service
# Uncomment lines 398-442 in docker-compose.yml
# Add API_SPORTS_KEY to environment
docker-compose up -d sports-api
```

**Rollback Time:** 5 minutes  
**Risk:** Very Low
