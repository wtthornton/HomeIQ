# PATH A: Sports Data Emancipation - Implementation Complete

**Date:** 2025-10-28  
**Epic:** Architecture Transformation  
**Story:** Remove sports-data service, use HACS integrations  

## Executive Summary

Successfully transformed HomeIQ architecture from trigger-controlling to pure intelligence layer by:
- Removing `sports-data` service (2,500+ lines deleted)
- Creating HA API client to read sports data from Home Assistant sensors
- Adding HACS status checking capabilities
- Providing installation guidance for users

**Architecture Principle Achieved:** 
- Home Assistant = Integration Hub (installs Team Tracker via HACS)
- HomeIQ = Intelligence Layer (reads HA sensors for analytics)

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Sports-Data Service

**Files Changed:**
- `docker-compose.yml` - Removed sports-data service definition
- Removed dependency from health-dashboard

**Files Deleted:**
- `services/sports-data/` - Entire directory removed

**Impact:**
- Eliminated ~2,500 lines of code
- Removed service that sent webhooks TO HA (violates architecture)
- No longer maintaining ESPN API integration

### 2. Created HA API Client

**File Created:** `services/health-dashboard/src/services/haClient.ts`

**Features:**
- Reads sensor states from Home Assistant via REST API
- Filters Team Tracker sensors (`sensor.team_tracker_*`)
- Filters NHL sensors (`sensor.nhl_*`)
- Configurable HA URL and token via environment variables

**API Integration:**
```typescript
// Read all states
await haClient.getAllStates();

// Get Team Tracker sensors specifically
await haClient.getTeamTrackerSensors();

// Get sensors by pattern
await haClient.getSensorsByPattern('^sensor\\.team_tracker_');
```

### 3. Updated Sports Data Hook

**File Modified:** `services/health-dashboard/src/hooks/useSportsData.ts`

**Changes:**
- Replaced sports-data API calls with HA REST API calls
- Added parsers for Team Tracker and NHL sensor formats
- Categorizes games by status (LIVE, SCHEDULED, COMPLETED)
- Filters games by team IDs and league

**Key Functions:**
- `parseTeamTrackerSensor()` - Converts HA sensor to Game object
- `parseNHLSensor()` - Converts NHL sensor to Game object
- `mapStatus()` - Maps sensor state to game status
- `shouldIncludeGame()` - Filters games by team/league

### 4. Added HACS Status Checking

**Backend Changes:**
- `services/ha-setup-service/src/integration_checker.py`
  - Added `check_hacs_integration()` method
  - Checks if HACS is installed via config entries
  - Checks if HACS entities exist
  - Verifies Team Tracker installation

**Frontend Changes:**
- `services/health-dashboard/src/components/sports/HACSStatusCheck.tsx`
  - Displays HACS installation status
  - Shows Team Tracker status
  - Provides interactive installation guide
  - Includes step-by-step instructions

**Diagnostic Script:**
- `scripts/check-hacs-status.py`
  - Standalone Python script for checking HACS status
  - Can be run independently for diagnostics
  - Provides installation guidance
  - Usage: `python scripts/check-hacs-status.py`

## Research Findings

### Can HACS Be Installed Via API?

**Answer: NO**

Research confirmed that HACS **cannot** be installed via Home Assistant API because:
1. HACS requires filesystem access to download installation files
2. Installation requires shell script execution (`wget -O - https://get.hacs.xyz | bash -`)
3. HACS needs file system modifications (creating `custom_components/hacs/`)
4. Requires Home Assistant restart after installation

**What CAN Be Done Via API:**
- ✅ Check if HACS is installed (query config entries and entities)
- ✅ Check if Team Tracker is installed
- ✅ Read sports data from HA sensors
- ❌ Install HACS (requires manual installation)
- ❌ Install Team Tracker (requires HACS UI interaction)

## New Data Flow

```
User manually installs HACS in HA
  ↓
User installs Team Tracker via HACS UI
  ↓
Team Tracker creates sensors in HA (sensor.team_tracker_*)
  ↓
HomeIQ Dashboard reads HA REST API
  ↓
Parse sensors and display games in Sports Tab
```

## Configuration Required

### Environment Variables

**For Dashboard:**
```env
VITE_HA_URL=http://192.168.1.86:8123
VITE_HA_TOKEN=your_long_lived_access_token
```

**For Diagnostic Script:**
```bash
export HA_HTTP_URL=http://192.168.1.86:8123
export HA_TOKEN=your_long_lived_access_token
```

### HA Setup Required

1. Install HACS (manual steps required)
2. Install Team Tracker via HACS
3. Configure teams in Team Tracker
4. Sports Tab will automatically read from HA sensors

## Usage Instructions

### For Users

1. **Check HACS Status:**
   - Run: `python scripts/check-hacs-status.py`
   - Or view Sports Tab in dashboard

2. **Install HACS** (if needed):
   - Follow instructions in HACSStatusCheck component
   - Or see: https://hacs.xyz/docs/setup/download

3. **Install Team Tracker:**
   - Open HACS in HA
   - Click Integrations → Search "Team Tracker"
   - Download and configure

4. **Use Sports Tab:**
   - Automatically reads from HA sensors
   - No configuration needed in HomeIQ

### For Developers

**Check HACS from Code:**
```python
# Via ha-setup-service
integration_checker = IntegrationHealthChecker()
hacs_status = await integration_checker.check_hacs_integration()
```

**Read Sports Data:**
```typescript
// Via React hook
const { liveGames, upcomingGames, completedGames } = useSportsData({
  teamIds: ['raiders', 'golden-knights'],
  league: 'all',
  pollInterval: 30000
});
```
