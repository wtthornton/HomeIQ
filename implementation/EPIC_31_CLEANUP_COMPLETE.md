## ✅ CLEANUP ACTIONS COMPLETED

### 1. Deleted Old Weather Files ✅

**Removed from websocket-ingestion/src:**
- `weather_cache.py` (8,531 bytes) - DELETED ✅
- `weather_client.py` (7,840 bytes) - DELETED ✅
- `weather_enrichment.py` (9,377 bytes) - DELETED ✅

**Total:** 25,748 bytes (26KB) of dead code removed

### 2. Removed Weather Field Writes ✅

**File:** `services/enrichment-pipeline/src/influxdb_wrapper.py`

**Changed:** Commented out weather field writes
- weather_temp (field) - No longer written
- weather_humidity (field) - No longer written
- weather_pressure (field) - No longer written
- weather_condition (tag) - No longer written

**Result:** New events will NOT have weather fields (clean schema)

### 3. Updated Documentation ✅

**File:** `docs/architecture/database-schema.md`

**Updates:**
- Marked weather_condition tag as DEPRECATED
- Added note about Epic 31 migration
- Updated weather_data bucket description (now for weather-api service)
- Documented backward compatibility (historical events retain weather)

### 4. Updated Environment Config ✅

**File:** `infrastructure/env.production`

**Changes:**
- Added deprecation comment for WEATHER_API_KEY
- Clarified it's now for weather-api service only
- Kept WEATHER_ENRICHMENT_ENABLED=false as documentation

### 5. Restarted Enrichment Pipeline ✅

**Action:** `docker-compose restart enrichment-pipeline`

**Result:** Service now uses updated code without weather writes
