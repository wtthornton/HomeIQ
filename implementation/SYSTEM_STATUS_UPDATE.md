# System Status Update - October 17, 2025

## 🎉 **MAJOR ISSUES RESOLVED**

### ✅ **MQTT Connection Fixed**
- **Issue**: ai-automation-service had MQTT connection failures (code 5 errors)
- **Root Cause**: Incorrect MQTT broker IP in configuration (172.18.0.1 instead of 192.168.1.86)
- **Solution**: Updated `infrastructure/env.ai-automation` with correct HA IP address
- **Result**: Service now connects successfully to MQTT broker and is HEALTHY

### ✅ **Energy Correlator Health Checks Fixed**
- **Issue**: 3333+ consecutive health check failures
- **Root Cause**: Health check was using wrong port (8016 instead of 8017)
- **Solution**: Corrected health check port in docker-compose.yml
- **Result**: Service is now healthy and functioning properly

### ✅ **Documentation Updated**
- **Updated**: README.md, architecture.md, tech-stack.md
- **Clarified**: Local services (localhost) vs Home Assistant integration (192.168.1.86)
- **Added**: Clear architecture diagrams showing correct IP addresses
