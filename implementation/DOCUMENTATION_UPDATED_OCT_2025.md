**Updates:**
- Added "Direct SQLite Storage" to features list
- Added complete "Device Discovery" section explaining automatic discovery
- Updated architecture diagram showing `HA → Discovery → Data-API → SQLite`
- Added `DATA_API_URL` and `STORE_DEVICE_HISTORY_IN_INFLUXDB` env vars

Direct storage from HA WebSocket → SQLite via HTTP POST
```

- Added troubleshooting note

**Removed**:
- `curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/api/discover` (no longer exists)

**Added**:
- Explanation that discovery is automatic
- PowerShell commands to verify device count
- Troubleshooting guidance

#### 9. `README.md` (Project Root) ✅
**Updates:**
- Added new "October 2025" section to Recent Updates
- Lists 4 key achievements:
  - Direct HA → SQLite storage fix
  - Real device data (99 devices, 100+ entities)
  - Eliminated sync scripts

- Implementation plan
- Benefits table

#### 12. `implementation/analysis/HA_DATA_SOURCE_ANALYSIS.md` ✅ NEW
**Contents:**

## Documentation Not Changed (Correct As-Is)

### Intentionally NOT Updated:
- `docs/architecture/tech-stack.md` - Tech stack unchanged ✅
- `docs/architecture/coding-standards.md` - Standards unchanged ✅
- `docs/architecture/source-tree.md` - Structure unchanged ✅
- Service Dockerfiles - No Docker changes needed ✅
- Test documentation - Tests still valid ✅

---

## Deprecated Documentation

### Scripts No Longer Needed:
These Python scripts should be archived or deleted:
- `sync_devices.py` - Manual InfluxDB → SQLite sync (automated now)
- `populate_sqlite.py` - Generated populate script (not needed)
- `simple_populate_sqlite.py` - Mock data script (replaced with real data)
- `scripts/discover-and-store-devices.py` - Manual discovery (automated now)

**Recommendation**: Move to `implementation/archive/deprecated-scripts/`

---

## New Environment Variables Documented

### websocket-ingestion
```bash
DATA_API_URL=http://homeiq-data-api:8006  # NEW
STORE_DEVICE_HISTORY_IN_INFLUXDB=false         # NEW (optional)
```

### Configuration Impact
- ✅ Added to `docker-compose.yml`
- ✅ Documented in service READMEs
- ✅ Explained in architecture docs
- ✅ Default values specified

---

## User-Facing Changes

### Dashboard Changes (After Browser Refresh)
**Before:**
- Devices: 5 (mock)
- Entities: 0
- Health: 0%

**After:**
- Devices: 99 (real from HA @ 192.168.1.86:8123)
- Entities: 100+ (real from HA)
- Health: Based on real integration states

### API Changes
**No Breaking Changes** - All existing endpoints work the same

**New Internal Endpoints** (not public-facing):
- `POST /internal/devices/bulk_upsert`
- `POST /internal/entities/bulk_upsert`

### Deployment Changes
**Simplified**:
- ❌ No manual sync scripts to run
- ✅ Automatic discovery on connection
- ✅ Real-time updates
- ✅ Less operational complexity

---

## Verification

### Check Documentation is Accurate

```bash
# 1. Verify device count in docs matches reality
curl http://localhost:8006/api/devices | jq '.count'
# Should show: 99 (matches docs ✅)

# 2. Verify discovery logs match documented flow
docker logs homeiq-websocket | grep "Starting device and entity discovery"
# Should see log entry ✅

# 3. Verify data-api logs show bulk upsert
docker logs homeiq-data-api | grep "bulk_upsert"
# Should show POST requests ✅
```

### Documentation Consistency Check

All docs consistently state:
- ✅ Direct HA → SQLite storage
- ✅ Automatic on WebSocket connection
- ✅ No manual sync needed
- ✅ 99 devices, 100+ entities
- ✅ InfluxDB optional for history
