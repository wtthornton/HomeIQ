# Context7 Knowledge Base - Cleanup Report

**Date**: 2025-10-13T15:10:00Z  
**Action**: Standard Cleanup (30-day threshold)  
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE - NO ACTION NEEDED**

---

## Executive Summary

Cleanup analysis completed successfully. **Zero entries qualify for removal** under the standard 30-day policy. All cache entries are fresh and within their retention period.

---

## Cleanup Policy

### Standard Cleanup Rules
```yaml
Threshold: 30 days old + 0 hits
Current Date: 2025-10-13
Cutoff Date: 2025-09-13 (30 days ago)
Auto Cleanup: Enabled
Min Hit Rate: 0.1 (10%)
```

### What Gets Cleaned Up?
Libraries are removed when they meet **ALL** criteria:
- ✅ Age > 30 days old
- ✅ Hit count = 0 (never accessed)
- ✅ Not in protected list
- ✅ Auto cleanup enabled

---

## Analysis Results

### Cache Entry Ages

**1 day old** (2025-10-12) - 4 entries:
- ✅ vitest (1 hit)

**6 days old** (2025-10-07) - 14 entries:
- ✅ fastapi (1 hit)
- ✅ aiohttp (1 hit)
- ✅ react (1 hit)
- ❌ vite (0 hits) - **24 days until cleanup**

### Cleanup Eligibility

| Criteria | Count | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Total Libraries | 18 | - |
| Unused (0 hits) | 12 | ⏳ Too new |
| 30+ days old | 0 | ✅ None |
| **Qualifies for cleanup** | **0** | ✅ **None** |

---

## Why Nothing Was Cleaned Up

### Reason: All Entries Too New ✅

The **oldest** cache entries are only **6 days old**, which is:
- ✅ **24 days** younger than the cleanup threshold
- ✅ Well within the retention period
- ✅ Following best practices (keep recent caches)

### Next Cleanup Opportunity

**2025-11-06** (24 days from now):
- 11 unused libraries will reach 30-day threshold
- Will be automatically removed if still unused
- Will free ~279 KB disk space

---

## Unused Library Status

### 12 Unused Libraries (0 Hits Each)

**Build Tools:**
- vite (23.5 KB, 6 days old)
- typescript (52.3 KB, 6 days old)

**UI Libraries:**
- tailwindcss (28.7 KB, 6 days old)
- heroicons (12.3 KB, 6 days old)

**Databases:**
- influxdb (34.6 KB, 6 days old)
- redis (32.1 KB, 6 days old)
- mongodb (0 KB, 6 days old - metadata only)
- elasticsearch (41.2 KB, 6 days old)

**Infrastructure:**
- docker (34.6 KB, 6 days old)
- python-logging (19.9 KB, 6 days old)

**Backend Frameworks:**
- express (0 KB, 6 days old - metadata only)

**Total Space**: 279.2 KB (0.28% of 100 MB max)

---

## Alternative: Aggressive Cleanup Option

If you want to clean up unused libraries **immediately** (ignore 30-day threshold):

### Aggressive Cleanup Would Remove:
- ❌ 11 libraries with 0 hits (mongodb and express are metadata-only)
- 💾 Free ~279 KB disk space
- ⚠️ Override standard retention policy

### Tech Stack Relevance Analysis

**Should Keep** (matches tech stack):
- influxdb ✅ (project uses InfluxDB)
- docker ✅ (project uses Docker)
- python-logging ✅ (project uses Python logging)
- typescript ✅ (project uses TypeScript)
- vite ✅ (project uses Vite)
- tailwindcss ✅ (project uses TailwindCSS)
- heroicons ✅ (project uses Heroicons)

**Could Remove** (not in tech stack):
- mongodb ❌ (not using MongoDB)
- redis ❌ (not using Redis)
- elasticsearch ❌ (not using Elasticsearch)
- express ❌ (using FastAPI, not Express)

### Aggressive Cleanup Command

To override the 30-day policy and remove **only non-tech-stack libraries**:

```bash
# Manual removal of non-tech-stack libraries (4 libraries)
rm docs/kb/context7-cache/libraries/mongodb/meta.yaml
rm docs/kb/context7-cache/libraries/redis/docs.md
rm docs/kb/context7-cache/libraries/redis/meta.yaml
rm docs/kb/context7-cache/libraries/elasticsearch/docs.md
rm docs/kb/context7-cache/libraries/elasticsearch/meta.yaml
rm docs/kb/context7-cache/libraries/express/meta.yaml

# Then rebuild index
*context7-kb-rebuild
```

**Savings**: ~106 KB (redis 32KB + elasticsearch 41KB + mongodb/express metadata)

---

## Recommendations

### ✅ Recommended: Keep Current State

**Reasons:**
1. **Space is not an issue** (1.87% of 100 MB max)
2. **Standard policy is working** (30-day retention is reasonable)
3. **Research flexibility** (unused libs may be useful later)
4. **Auto-cleanup scheduled** (2025-11-06 if still unused)

### ⚠️ Optional: Aggressive Cleanup

Only consider if:
- Disk space is constrained (it's not - 98% free)
- You're certain you'll never use these libraries
- You want faster search results (minimal impact)

### 📊 Monitor and Review

**Next actions:**
1. **2025-11-06**: Auto-cleanup will remove unused entries (if still 0 hits)
2. **Monthly**: Run `*context7-kb-status` to review cache health
3. **As needed**: Run `*context7-kb-analytics` for detailed usage patterns

## System Health After Cleanup

### ✅ All Metrics Healthy

```yaml
Cache Status: Healthy ✅
Index Status: Synchronized ✅
Total Entries: 21 (unchanged)
Cache Size: 1.87 MB (unchanged)
Cache Hit Rate: 33% (unchanged)
Unused Entries: 12 (retained - too new)
Stale Entries: 0 (all fresh)
Disk Usage: 1.87% (healthy)
```

---

## Conclusion

✅ **Cleanup completed successfully with zero actions required!**

### Key Findings:
- ✅ All cache entries are within retention period
- ✅ No files qualify for cleanup (all < 30 days old)
- ✅ Standard retention policy is working correctly
- ✅ Auto-cleanup scheduled for 2025-11-06

### System Status: **OPTIMAL** 💚

The cache is healthy, and the retention policy is functioning as designed. No manual intervention needed.

### What Happens Next:

**Automatic:**
- System will auto-check unused entries on 2025-11-06
- If still unused, 11 libraries will be automatically removed
- You'll be notified of any cleanup actions

**Manual Options:**
- Run `*context7-kb-cleanup` anytime to check eligibility
- Run `*context7-kb-status` to monitor cache health
- Override policy with aggressive cleanup (see above) if needed
