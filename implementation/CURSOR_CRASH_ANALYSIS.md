# Cursor Crash Analysis Report

**Date:** January 15, 2026  
**Service:** `ai-automation-service-new`  
**Task:** Code review using tapps-agents

## Executive Summary

Cursor IDE experienced a connection failure during a code review operation. While the immediate cause was a network/backend connection issue, several underlying problems contributed to the instability:

1. **Debug log write failures** - tapps-agents attempted to write to a non-existent directory
2. **Long-running operation** - Code review took 30+ seconds, potentially triggering timeout
3. **Connection error** - Backend service connection was lost

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Cause: Connection Error

The crash was directly caused by a connection failure to Cursor's backend service:
- **Error Message:** "Connection failed. If the problem persists, please check your internet connection or VPN"
- **Request ID:** `a8a33c71-e0e3-4bd9-83d9-eaddb6a971e3`
- **Timing:** Occurred during execution of `reviewer score` command (30-31 seconds into execution)

### Contributing Factors

#### 1. Debug Log Write Failures

**Error:**
```
DEBUG LOG WRITE FAILED: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 
'C:\cursor\HomeIQ\services\ai-automation-service-new\.cursor\debug.log'
```

**Root Cause:**
- **Code Location:** `tapps_agents/agents/reviewer/agent.py:733`
- **Problem:** Uses `Path.cwd() / ".cursor" / "debug.log"` instead of project root
- **Technical Details:**
  - `Path.cwd()` returns current working directory (`services/ai-automation-service-new/`)
  - Should use `self._project_root` or detect project root via `.tapps-agents/` marker
  - The `.cursor` directory exists at project root (`C:\cursor\HomeIQ\.cursor\`), not in subdirectories
  - Directory creation is not attempted before write operation
  - **Related Code:** `tapps_agents/core/path_validator.py:43-54` (project root detection pattern)

**Impact:**
- **Severity:** Medium (non-fatal but indicates architectural issue)
- Non-fatal errors (tool continued execution)
- Indicates path resolution inconsistency in tapps-agents
- May contribute to resource strain (repeated failed I/O operations)
- Error messages printed to stderr may confuse users

**Fix Required:**
1. **Immediate:** Use project root detection (similar to `PathValidator._detect_project_root()`)
2. **Short-term:** Create `.cursor` directory if it doesn't exist before writing
3. **Long-term:** Centralize debug logging with proper error handling (non-blocking)

#### 2. Long-Running Operation

**Timeline:**
- `reviewer review` command: Completed successfully (14.8s)
- `reviewer score` command: Running for 30-31 seconds when connection failed

**Analysis:**
- Reviewing entire `src/` directory is computationally expensive
- Multiple files being analyzed (14+ Python files based on directory structure)
- Each file requires:
  - Complexity analysis
  - Security scanning
  - Maintainability scoring
  - Type checking
  - Linting
  - Test coverage analysis

**Impact:**
- Long operations increase timeout risk
- Backend may have strict timeout limits
- Resource consumption during extended operations

**Recommendations:**
- Use `--max-workers` to limit concurrent operations
- Review specific files instead of entire directories when possible
- Consider breaking large reviews into smaller batches
- Add progress indicators for long operations

#### 3. PowerShell Command Syntax Issues

**Initial Error:**
```
ParserError: InvalidEndOfLine
```

**Resolution:**
- Changed from `&&` (bash syntax) to `;` (PowerShell syntax)
- Command: `cd services/ai-automation-service-new; python -m tapps_agents.cli reviewer review src/`

**Impact:**
- Minor delay, but resolved quickly
- Indicates need for better PowerShell compatibility in documentation

## Technical Context

### tapps-agents Architecture

**Project Root Detection:**
- tapps-agents uses `.tapps-agents/` directory as project root marker
- `PathValidator._detect_project_root()` (code: `tapps_agents/core/path_validator.py:43-54`) walks up directory tree to find marker
- Current working directory (`Path.cwd()`) may not be project root
- When running from subdirectories, `Path.cwd()` returns subdirectory, not project root

**Debug Logging Pattern:**
- Multiple agents use `Path.cwd() / ".cursor" / "debug.log"` pattern
- **Affected Files:**
  - `tapps_agents/agents/reviewer/agent.py:733`
  - `tapps_agents/context7/backup_client.py:64`
  - `tapps_agents/context7/agent_integration.py:50`
  - `tapps_agents/continuous_bug_fix/bug_fix_coordinator.py:59`
- This is inconsistent with project root detection used elsewhere
- Should be centralized in a logging utility using project root detection

**Reviewer Agent Execution:**
- `reviewer score` analyzes multiple files sequentially or in parallel
- Each file requires: complexity, security, maintainability, type checking, linting
- Default `--max-workers` is 4, but can be configured
- No progress reporting for long operations
- **Code Reference:** `tapps_agents/agents/reviewer/agent.py:_review_file_internal`

### Cursor IDE Integration

**Connection Timeout:**
- Cursor IDE backend has timeout limits (exact duration unknown)
- Long-running operations (>30s) may trigger timeouts
- Connection failures are transient but can interrupt operations

**Worktree Management:**
- Cursor uses worktrees for isolated execution
- Debug logs should be written to worktree-specific locations or project root
- **Code Reference:** `tapps_agents/workflow/cursor_skill_helper.py:135`

## Technical Details

### Command Execution Sequence

1. **First Attempt (Failed):**
   ```powershell

## Recommendations

### 🔴 Critical Priority (Fix Immediately)

#### 1. Fix Debug Log Path Resolution
**Issue:** Debug logs fail when running from subdirectories  
**Code Location:** `tapps_agents/agents/reviewer/agent.py:733`  
**Impact:** User confusion, potential resource waste  
**Effort:** Low (1-2 hours)  
**Implementation:**
```python
# In reviewer/agent.py, replace:
log_path = PathType.cwd() / ".cursor" / "debug.log"

# With:
from ...core.path_validator import PathValidator
validator = PathValidator()
log_path = validator.project_root / ".cursor" / "debug.log"
log_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
```

**Testing:**
- Run `reviewer score` from project root ✅
- Run `reviewer score` from subdirectory ✅
- Verify debug.log created in correct location ✅

#### 2. Add Non-Blocking Error Handling for Debug Logs
**Issue:** Debug log failures may contribute to instability  
**Code Location:** `tapps_agents/agents/reviewer/agent.py:733-748`  
**Impact:** Prevents cascading failures  
**Effort:** Low (30 minutes)  
**Implementation:**
```python
try:
    with open(log_path, "a", encoding="utf-8") as f:
        # ... write log ...
except (OSError, IOError) as e:
    # Silently ignore - debug logs are non-critical
    logger.debug(f"Debug log write failed (non-critical): {e}")
```

### 🟡 High Priority (Fix Soon)

#### 3. Add Progress Indicators for Long Operations
**Issue:** No feedback during 30+ second operations  
**Code Location:** `tapps_agents/cli/commands/reviewer.py:146-340`  
**Impact:** User uncertainty, timeout risk  
**Effort:** Medium (4-6 hours)  
**Implementation:**
- Use existing `ProgressReporter` or `FeedbackManager`
- Show progress every 5-10 seconds for operations >10s
- Display: "Reviewing file X of Y... (Z%)"

#### 4. Implement Connection Retry Logic
**Issue:** Single connection failure causes complete failure  
**Code Location:** Cursor Skills integration layer  
**Impact:** Improved reliability  
**Effort:** Medium (6-8 hours)  
**Implementation:**
- Add retry decorator with exponential backoff
- Retry up to 3 times for transient network errors
- Log retry attempts for debugging

### 🟢 Medium Priority (Nice to Have)

#### 5. Optimize Batch Review Performance
**Issue:** Reviewing entire directories is slow  
**Code Location:** `tapps_agents/agents/reviewer/agent.py:_review_file_internal`  
**Impact:** Better user experience  
**Effort:** High (1-2 days)  
**Implementation:**
- Implement result caching (already exists but may need optimization)
- Add incremental review mode (only changed files)
- Parallel processing with configurable worker limits

#### 6. Improve PowerShell Documentation
**Issue:** Users hit syntax errors with bash-style commands  
**Code Location:** Documentation files  
**Impact:** Better developer experience  
**Effort:** Low (1-2 hours)  
**Implementation:**
- Add PowerShell examples to command reference
- Add note about `&&` vs `;` in Windows documentation

## Workaround

For future code reviews, use these optimized commands:

```powershell
# Review specific files instead of entire directory
cd services/ai-automation-service-new
python -m tapps_agents.cli reviewer review src/main.py src/config.py --format json --output review-results.json

# Or use max-workers to limit concurrency
python -m tapps_agents.cli reviewer review src/ --format json --output review-results.json --max-workers 2

# For scoring, review smaller batches
python -m tapps_agents.cli reviewer score src/main.py --format json
```
