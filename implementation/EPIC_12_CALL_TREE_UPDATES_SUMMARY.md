#### Service Ports Table
- ✅ Added Epic 12 update note above Epic 13 note

#### Architecture Diagram
- ✅ Updated InfluxDB box:

- ✅ Updated Data API Service box:
  - Added [Epic 12] annotation to "Sports & HA Automation (9 routes)"
  - Added bullet points:
    - "Historical queries from InfluxDB"
    - "HA automation endpoints (<50ms)"
    - "Webhook management"

**Key Additions:**
```
> **Epic 12 Note**: While this document focuses on Home Assistant event flow, 
> the sports-data service now also writes to InfluxDB (similar to Pattern A services) 
> and supports webhooks for HA automations. See EXTERNAL_API_CALL_TREES.md for 
> sports data flow details.
```

## 🎯 Epic 12 Implementation Overview

### What Was Added to Call Trees

**InfluxDB Persistence:**
- Sports data now writes to InfluxDB measurements: `nfl_scores`, `nhl_scores`
- 2-year retention policy (730 days)
- Async, non-blocking writes (don't impact API response times)
- Batch writing with 100 points per batch, 10-second flush interval

**Historical Queries:**
- `/api/v1/sports/games/history` - Query by team/season/status
- `/api/v1/sports/games/timeline/{game_id}` - Score progression
- `/api/v1/sports/games/schedule/{team}` - Full season schedule
- SQL queries from InfluxDB with pagination
- Statistical calculations (wins, losses, win percentage)

**HA Automation:**
- `/api/v1/ha/game-status/{team}` - Fast status checks (<50ms)
- `/api/v1/ha/game-context/{team}` - Rich game context
- Optimized for Home Assistant automation triggers

**Webhooks:**
- Registration endpoint: `/api/v1/ha/webhooks/register`
- HMAC-SHA256 signatures for security
- Event types: game_start, game_end, score_change
- Retry logic: 3 attempts with exponential backoff
- Persistent storage in JSON file

**Background Tasks:**
- Event detector runs every 15 seconds
- Monitors game state changes
- Triggers webhooks automatically
- Compares current vs previous state

## 📊 Data Flow Updates

### Before Epic 12 (Pattern B Only)
```
ESPN API → Sports Service (cache) → Data API → Dashboard
                                   ↓
                              Cache Expires
                                   ↓
                              Data Lost
```

### After Epic 12 (Hybrid Pattern A+B)
```
ESPN API → Sports Service → Cache (fast reads) → Data API → Dashboard
                ↓                                     ↑
           InfluxDB Writer (async)                   │
                ↓                                     │
           InfluxDB (persistent)                     │
                ↓                                     │
           Historical Queries ─────────────────────────
                ↓
           HA Automation Endpoints
                ↓
           Webhook System
```

## 🔄 Pattern Evolution

### Pattern A: Continuous Push (Unchanged)
- Services: Air Quality, Carbon, Electricity, Smart Meter, Calendar
- Behavior: Periodic background fetching → InfluxDB write
- Use Case: Time-series data for trending

### Pattern B: On-Demand Pull (Original)
- Services: Sports Data (before Epic 12)
- Behavior: Request-driven → Cache only → No persistence
- Use Case: Real-time data that changes frequently

### **Pattern A+B: Hybrid (New - Epic 12)**
- Services: **Sports Data (after Epic 12)**
- Behavior: Request-driven (B) + Async InfluxDB writes (A) + Background events
- Use Case: Real-time data + Historical analysis + Automation triggers
- Key Feature: Non-blocking persistence (best of both patterns)
