# Entity State Passthrough Deployment Complete

**Date:** October 29, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Successfully Deployed

## Summary

The `get_entity_state()` passthrough method has been successfully added to the `HomeAssistantClient` and deployed to production. This method allows the system to fetch entity state and attributes (including `is_hue_group`) directly from Home Assistant.

## What Was Done

### 1. Added Passthrough Method
- **File**: `services/ai-automation-service/src/clients/ha_client.py`
- **Method**: `get_entity_state(entity_id: str)`
- **Purpose**: Fetch entity state with attributes from HA's `/api/states/{entity_id}` endpoint
- **Returns**: Full state object with attributes (including `is_hue_group` for Hue entities)

### 2. Deployment
- ✅ Docker image rebuilt successfully
- ✅ Service restarted successfully
- ✅ Test passed (50.12s execution time)

## Current Status

✅ **Infrastructure Ready**: The method is deployed and working  
⏳ **Not Yet Used**: Entity resolution hasn't been updated to use this method yet  

## Next Steps

The passthrough method is ready to use, but needs to be integrated into entity resolution logic. Potential next steps:

1. **Update entity resolution** to call `get_entity_state()` for candidate entities
2. **Check `is_hue_group` attribute** to distinguish room groups from individual lights
3. **Use correct entity type** in YAML generation (group vs individual)

## Test Results

```
Test: test_ask_ai_specific_ids
Status: PASSED
Execution Time: 50.12s
```

## Method Usage Example

```python
# Get entity state with attributes
state = await ha_client.get_entity_state('light.office')

# Check if it's a Hue room group
if state and state.get('attributes', {}).get('is_hue_group'):
    # This is a room group entity
    print("Controls all office lights")
else:
    # This is an individual light
    print("Single light entity")
```

## Architecture Decision

**Decision**: Passthrough to HA instead of storing attributes in database

**Reasons**:
1. Entity attributes differ from device attributes
2. Attributes can change frequently
3. Home Assistant is the authoritative source
4. Avoids database storage overhead
5. Always returns current, accurate data
