## 🚨 Critical Issues (MUST FIX)

### 1. ❌ **Missing data-api in Production Compose**
**File:** `docker-compose.prod.yml`  
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Impact:** Production deployment will fail - dashboard cannot access device/entity data

**Fix:**
```bash
# Option A: Use main compose for production (RECOMMENDED)
cp docker-compose.yml docker-compose.prod.yml

# Option B: Manually add data-api service to docker-compose.prod.yml
# Copy the entire data-api section from docker-compose.yml
```

**Why This is Critical:**
- data-api provides device/entity browsing (port 8006)
- Dashboard depends on this service
- Without it, major features will be broken

---

## ⚠️ Warnings (SHOULD FIX)

### 2. ⚠️ **Incomplete Service Dependencies**
**File:** `docker-compose.yml` (line 186)  
**Impact:** admin-api may start before data-api is ready

**Fix:**
```yaml
# In docker-compose.yml, admin-api service
depends_on:
  influxdb:
    condition: service_healthy
  websocket-ingestion:
    condition: service_healthy
  enrichment-pipeline:
    condition: service_healthy
  data-api:                    # ← ADD THIS
    condition: service_healthy  # ← ADD THIS
```

### 3. ⚠️ **Missing Services in Production Compose**
**File:** `docker-compose.prod.yml`  
**Missing:**
- log-aggregator (port 8015)
- sports-data (port 8005)
- carbon-intensity (port 8010)
- electricity-pricing (port 8011)
- air-quality (port 8012)
- calendar (port 8013)
- smart-meter (port 8014)

**Recommendation:** Use `docker-compose.yml` as your production configuration, as it's more complete.

### 4. ⚠️ **No Root .dockerignore**
**Impact:** Larger Docker build context, slower builds

**Fix:**
```bash
# Create .dockerignore in project root
cat > .dockerignore << 'EOF'
.git/
docs/
implementation/
tests/
*.md
!README.md
.env*
!.env.example
node_modules/
__pycache__/
*.log
EOF
```

---

## ℹ️ Minor Issues (OPTIONAL FIX)

### 5. data-api Runs as Root
**File:** `services/data-api/Dockerfile`  
**Impact:** Slightly less secure  
**Fix:** Add `USER` directive (like websocket-ingestion Dockerfile)

### 6. Inconsistent Python Versions
**Files:** Various Dockerfiles  
**Detail:** Mix of Python 3.11 and 3.12  
**Impact:** Minimal - both are supported  
**Recommendation:** Standardize on 3.12 for new deployments

### 7. Port Mapping Inconsistency
**File:** `docker-compose.yml` (line 156)  
**Detail:** admin-api maps 8003:8004 instead of 8004:8004  
**Impact:** None - just a style preference  
**Note:** External port 8003 is documented everywhere, so this is fine
