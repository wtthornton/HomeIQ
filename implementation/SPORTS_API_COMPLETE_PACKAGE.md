## üìñ Context7 KB Integration

### Research Applied
‚úÖ **aiohttp** (`/aio-libs/aiohttp`)
- ClientSession with connection pooling
- TCPConnector configuration
- Timeout management
- Graceful shutdown pattern
- Retry middleware

‚úÖ **InfluxDB** (`/influxcommunity/influxdb3-python`)
- Point class for data construction
- Batch writing with WriteOptions
- Success/error/retry callbacks
- Query modes (SQL, InfluxQL, Pandas)
- Performance optimization

### Best Practices
- Connection pooling (limit=30, limit_per_host=10)
- Request timeouts (total=30s, connect=10s)
- Exponential backoff retry
- Batch writing optimization
- Tag cardinality management
- Query pattern optimization

---

## üîç InfluxDB Schema Highlights

### Measurements Designed
1. **nfl_scores** - Live and historical NFL game scores
2. **nhl_scores** - Live and historical NHL game scores
3. **nfl_player_stats** - Player statistics by game
4. **nfl_injuries** - Injury reports with status tracking
5. **nfl_standings** / **nhl_standings** - League standings

### Schema Optimization
- **Tags**: Team names, conferences, divisions, game IDs (indexed)
- **Fields**: Scores, statistics, status (measurement data)
- **Cardinality**: <10K unique values per tag
- **Batch Writing**: 100 points per batch, 10s flush
- **Retention**: 2 years (events), 5 years (standings)

### Query Patterns
```sql
-- Live games
SELECT * FROM nfl_scores WHERE status = 'live' AND time > now() - 4h

-- Team season
SELECT * FROM nfl_scores WHERE season = '2025' AND home_team = 'Patriots'

-- Player stats
SELECT SUM(passing_yards) FROM nfl_player_stats 
WHERE player_id = 'abc123' AND season = '2025'
```
