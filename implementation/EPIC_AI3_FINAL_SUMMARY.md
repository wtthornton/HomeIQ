## 🎬 Deployment Instructions

### Step 1: Database Migration

```bash
cd services/ai-automation-service
alembic upgrade head
```

**Expected Output:**
```
INFO  [alembic.runtime.migration] Running upgrade 20251016_095206 -> 20251018_synergy
INFO  [alembic.runtime.migration] Adding synergy_opportunities table
```

### Step 2: Restart Services

```bash
# From project root
docker-compose restart ai-automation-service
docker-compose restart ai-automation-ui
```

**Expected Output:**
```
[+] Restarting 2/2
 ✔ Container ai-automation-service  Started
 ✔ Container ai-automation-ui  Started
```

### Step 3: Verification

**Backend Check:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:8018/api/synergies/stats
```

**Frontend Check:**
- Navigate to http://localhost:3001/synergies
- Should see "Automation Opportunities" page
- Stats cards should display
- Filter pills should work

**Daily Batch Check:**
- Wait for 3 AM OR trigger manually
- Check logs for Phase 3c synergy detection
- Verify synergies stored in database

### Step 4: Monitor

**Watch for these log messages:**
```
🔗 Phase 3c/7: Synergy Detection (Epic AI-3)...
✅ Device synergy detection complete: X synergies
🌤️ Part B: Weather opportunity detection...
⚡ Part C: Energy opportunity detection...
🔗 Generating synergy-based suggestions...
✅ Synergy suggestion generation complete: X suggestions
```

## 📈 Expected Outcomes (First Week)

### Day 1 (First Batch Run)

**Synergies Detected:** 5-15 opportunities
- Device pairs: 3-8
- Weather: 0-2 (depends on forecast)
- Energy: 0-3 (if pricing data available)
- Events: 0-2

**Suggestions Generated:** 8-12 total
- Pattern: 3-5
- Feature: 2-4
- **Synergy: 2-5** ← NEW

### Week 1 Metrics

**Daily Suggestions:** 8-12 (was 5-8)  
**User Approval Rate:** Monitor (target >70%)  
**Cost:** ~$0.002-0.004/day (~$0.01-0.03/week)  
**Performance:** 4-7 minutes/batch (target <10min)

---

## 🔍 What to Watch

### Success Indicators ✅

- Synergies appearing in daily logs
- Synergy suggestions in Suggestions Tab
- /synergies page loading successfully
- Users approving synergy suggestions
- Cost staying <$0.01/day

### Potential Issues ⚠️

- **No synergies detected:** Check that devices exist in same areas
- **Weather opportunities = 0:** Normal if no extreme weather
- **Energy opportunities = 0:** Normal if no pricing data available
- **API errors:** Check HA connection, InfluxDB availability

---

## 💡 Future Enhancements (Post-Epic)
