# Story Updates: Unified Batch Architecture

**Date:** 2025-10-16  
**Change:** Migrated from real-time MQTT listener to unified daily batch job  
**Reason:** User identified that real-time adds complexity without user benefit

## Key Changes

### Story 2.1: MQTT Capability Listener ‚Üí Batch Discovery

**Before:**
```
Story 2.1: MQTT Capability Listener & Universal Parser
- Subscribe to MQTT topic (24/7)
- Process messages in real-time
- Memory: ~50MB continuous
- Uptime: 730 hrs/month
```

**After:**
```
Story 2.1: Batch Device Capability Discovery & Universal Parser
- Query MQTT topic during daily batch (3 AM)
- Process all devices once per day
- Memory: ~100MB for 5-10 min
- Uptime: 2.5 hrs/month (99% less!)
```

**Rationale:**
- Device capabilities are static metadata (rarely change)
- New devices added monthly, not secondly
- Suggestions are batched daily anyway (no benefit to real-time discovery)
- Same user experience: User wakes up to suggestions at 7 AM regardless

---

### Story 2.5: Suggestion Merge ‚Üí Unified Daily Batch Job

**Before:**
```
Story 2.5: Unified Suggestion Pipeline (Pattern + Feature Merge)
- Epic-AI-1 runs independently (pattern detection)
- Epic-AI-2 runs independently (feature analysis)  
- Merge suggestions afterward
- 6-8 hours estimated
```

**After:**
```
Story 2.5: Unified Daily Batch Job (Pattern + Feature Analysis)
- Single 3 AM job combines BOTH epics
- Shared InfluxDB query (one 30-day fetch)
- Combined analysis and suggestion generation
- 10-12 hours estimated (includes refactoring Story 2.1)
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Single point of control
- ‚úÖ Shared data (InfluxDB query happens once)
- ‚úÖ Combined suggestions (can create hybrid recommendations)
- ‚úÖ Simpler monitoring (one job vs. multiple services)
- ‚úÖ Lower resource usage

## User Feedback That Led to This Change

> "What is the value of realtime? What would MQTT just be a data source that fills the InfluxDB and the data is used in the same daily (30 day) review? I don't see the value of realtime at this point."

**Analysis:**
- ‚úÖ User is 100% correct
- Real-time discovery has NO user-facing benefit
- Device capabilities discovered at 5 PM vs. 3 AM next day = same 7 AM result
- Since suggestions are batched daily, real-time adds complexity without value
- MQTT should be treated as a **data source**, not a **real-time stream**

- 99% less resource usage (2.5 hrs vs. 730 hrs/month)
- Simpler monitoring and failure modes
- Shared data improves efficiency
- Enables combined/hybrid suggestions

**Status:**
- ‚úÖ Stories updated in PRD
- ‚úÖ Architecture documented
- ‚úÖ Analysis complete
- ‚è≥ Implementation pending (Story 2.5)

**Next Steps:**
1. Complete Story 2.4 testing (current work)
2. Begin Story 2.5 implementation (unified batch)
3. Test full pipeline
4. Deploy to production
