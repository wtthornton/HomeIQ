# Feature Discoverability

**Last Updated**: December 2025  
**Status**: Current feature discovery strategies for 2025

## The Discovery Problem

### Problem Statement

Users miss 70-90% of device features because they don't know they exist or how to use them.

**Common Issues**:
- Features hidden in menus
- No indication features exist
- Technical documentation not user-friendly
- Features require technical knowledge to discover

### Impact

**For Users**:
- Missing valuable functionality
- Underutilizing devices
- Not getting full value from purchases
- Frustration when discovering missed features

**For System**:
- Lower user satisfaction
- Reduced system value perception
- Missed opportunities for engagement

## Discovery Strategies

### 1. Proactive Feature Suggestions

**Strategy**: System actively suggests unused features based on device capabilities.

**When to Suggest**:
- Device utilization <50%
- Feature aligns with user patterns
- Feature provides clear benefit
- User has compatible devices/setup

**Presentation**:
- "Did you know your [device] can [feature]?"
- Include benefit explanation
- Provide setup guidance
- Show examples of use

**Frequency**: 1 feature suggestion per day (rotate devices)

### 2. Contextual Discovery

**Strategy**: Show features in context where they're relevant.

**Implementation**:
- Show LED notification options when configuring lights
- Show power monitoring when viewing energy usage
- Show advanced settings when user accesses device
- Show related features when user uses similar features

**Benefits**:
- Relevant timing improves adoption
- Context helps understanding
- Natural discovery flow

### 3. Visual Indicators

**Strategy**: Use visual cues to indicate available features.

**Indicators**:
- Badges on devices with unused features
- "New" indicators for undiscovered features
- Progress bars showing feature utilization
- Icons indicating feature availability

**Placement**:
- Device cards/lists
- Dashboard widgets
- Navigation menus
- Settings pages

### 4. Guided Discovery

**Strategy**: Provide guided tours and tutorials for features.

**Implementation**:
- Interactive feature tours
- Step-by-step setup wizards
- Video tutorials
- In-app help overlays

**Timing**:
- Onboarding for new devices
- When user shows interest (clicks "Learn more")
- Periodic reminders for unused features

### 5. Pattern-Based Discovery

**Strategy**: Suggest features based on user behavior patterns.

**Example**:
- User frequently adjusts lights manually → Suggest scheduling features
- User checks energy usage often → Suggest power monitoring features
- User uses multiple similar devices → Suggest group/scene features

**Benefits**:
- Personalized discovery
- Higher relevancy
- Better adoption rates

## Discovery Best Practices

### Clear Communication

**Do**:
- Use plain language (no technical jargon)
- Explain benefits clearly
- Show examples of use
- Provide setup guidance

**Don't**:
- Use technical terminology
- Assume user knows feature exists
- Provide vague descriptions
- Require external documentation

### Non-Intrusive Discovery

**Do**:
- Suggest at appropriate times
- Allow easy dismissal
- Don't interrupt user workflows
- Respect user preferences

**Don't**:
- Overwhelm with too many suggestions
- Interrupt critical tasks
- Force discovery (always allow skip)
- Repeat same suggestions

### Measurable Benefits

**Do**:
- Quantify benefits when possible
- Show before/after comparisons
- Provide ROI estimates
- Highlight time/money savings

**Don't**:
- Make vague claims
- Overpromise benefits
- Hide costs/complexity
- Ignore setup time

## Feature Utilization Tracking

### Metrics

**Utilization Rate**:
- % of available features being used
- Track per device, per feature type
- Identify underutilized areas

**Discovery Rate**:
- % of users who discover specific features
- Time to discovery
- Discovery channels (suggestion, manual, tutorial)

**Adoption Rate**:
- % of users who try suggested features
- % who continue using after trial
- Retention rate for discovered features

### Utilization Targets

**Device Level**:
- Target: >50% feature utilization
- High performers: >70% utilization
- Underperformers: <30% utilization (focus area)

**Feature Type Level**:
- Basic features: >80% utilization expected
- Advanced features: >40% utilization expected
- Expert features: >20% utilization expected

## Improving Discovery

### Analysis

**Identify**:
- Features with low discovery rates
- Devices with low utilization
- Discovery channels that work best
- User segments with low discovery

**Investigate**:
- Why features aren't discovered
- Barriers to discovery
- User feedback on suggestions
- Discovery timing effectiveness

### Optimization

**Actions**:
- Improve suggestion messaging
- Adjust discovery timing
- Enhance visual indicators
- Create better tutorials
- Personalize suggestions

**Measure**:
- Track improvement in discovery rates
- Monitor adoption after improvements
- Collect user feedback
- A/B test different approaches
