# Demand Response Strategies

**Last Updated**: December 2025  
**Status**: Current demand response programs and strategies for 2025

## Demand Response Overview

### Definition

**Demand Response**: Programs that incentivize users to reduce electricity consumption during periods of high demand or high prices.

### Objectives

**For Utilities**:
- Balance supply and demand
- Reduce need for peak power plants
- Improve grid stability
- Lower overall system costs

**For Users**:
- Reduce energy bills
- Earn incentives/income
- Support renewable energy
- Reduce environmental impact

## Program Types

### 1. Price-Based Programs

**Mechanism**: Users respond to time-varying electricity prices.

**Examples**:
- Time-of-Use (TOU) rates
- Real-Time Pricing (RTP)
- Critical Peak Pricing (CPP)

**User Action**: Shift or reduce usage during high-price periods.

**Benefits**:
- Lower energy bills
- Flexible participation
- No commitment required

### 2. Incentive-Based Programs

**Mechanism**: Utilities pay users to reduce demand during specific events.

**Event Types**:
- Peak demand events (summer afternoons)
- Grid emergencies
- Supply shortages

**Payment Structure**:
- $0.50-2.00 per kWh reduced
- Fixed payment per event
- Capacity payments (monthly)

**User Action**: Reduce consumption when notified of event.

**Benefits**:
- Direct income
- Significant savings potential
- Support grid reliability

### 3. Capacity Programs

**Mechanism**: Long-term commitment to provide demand reduction capacity.

**Structure**:
- Commit to reduce X kW during peak periods
- Monthly capacity payments
- Performance requirements

**User Action**: Maintain reduction capability, perform when called.

**Benefits**:
- Predictable income
- Higher payments
- Long-term relationship

## Participation Strategies

### Load Shifting

**Strategy**: Move energy-intensive tasks to off-peak or lower-price periods.

**Applications**:
- Dishwasher (delay to off-peak)
- Laundry (delay to off-peak)
- EV charging (schedule for off-peak)
- Water heating (pre-heat during off-peak)

**Savings**: 20-40% on shifted loads

### Load Shedding

**Strategy**: Temporarily reduce or eliminate non-essential loads during events.

**Applications**:
- Reduce heating/cooling (within comfort limits)
- Defer pool pumps
- Reduce water heating
- Turn off non-essential devices

**Savings**: $10-50 per event depending on reduction

### Pre-Conditioning

**Strategy**: Pre-cool or pre-heat during low-price periods to reduce demand during high-price periods.

**Applications**:
- Pre-cool house before peak
- Pre-heat water before peak
- Charge batteries during off-peak for peak discharge

**Savings**: Maintain comfort while reducing peak demand

### Battery Storage

**Strategy**: Use battery to shift load from peak to off-peak periods.

**Mechanism**:
- Charge battery during low-price off-peak
- Discharge battery during high-price peak
- Reduce grid consumption during peak

**Savings**: Price difference × battery capacity (e.g., $0.20/kWh difference × 10 kWh = $2 per cycle)

## Optimization Strategies

### Automated Response

**Implementation**:
- Monitor price signals or event notifications
- Automatically adjust devices/systems
- Optimize for maximum savings
- Maintain user comfort preferences

**Benefits**:
- No manual intervention required
- Optimal response timing
- Consistent participation
- Maximize savings

### User Preferences

**Settings**:
- Comfort thresholds (temperature limits)
- Priority devices (what can be adjusted)
- Participation level (aggressive vs conservative)
- Notification preferences

**Balance**: Maximize savings while respecting user preferences

### Predictive Optimization

**Strategy**: Use forecasts to optimize pre-conditioning and scheduling.

**Applications**:
- Forecast peak pricing
- Pre-cool/pre-heat based on forecast
- Schedule tasks based on price forecast
- Optimize battery charging/discharging

**Benefits**: Better optimization, higher savings

## Economic Analysis

### Revenue Calculation

**Price-Based Programs**:
- Revenue = Load Shifted (kWh) × Price Difference ($/kWh)

**Incentive-Based Programs**:
- Revenue = Reduction (kWh) × Incentive Rate ($/kWh)

**Capacity Programs**:
- Revenue = Capacity (kW) × Payment Rate ($/kW/month)

### Participation Costs

**Equipment Costs**:
- Smart thermostats, controllers
- Battery storage (optional)
- Automation systems

**Opportunity Costs**:
- Reduced comfort (within limits)
- Deferred usage (non-essential tasks)
- Maintenance/management time

### Net Benefit

**Calculation**: Revenue - Costs = Net Benefit

**Example** (Incentive-Based Program):
- Annual participation: 10 events
- Average reduction: 5 kWh per event
- Incentive rate: $1.00/kWh
- Annual revenue: 10 × 5 × $1.00 = $50
- Costs: $10 (minimal, using existing automation)
- Net benefit: $40/year

## Best Practices

### Start Simple

**Initial Participation**:
- Focus on easy wins (load shifting)
- Use existing automation
- Minimal equipment investment
- Learn program mechanics

**Progressive Enhancement**:
- Add more sophisticated strategies
- Invest in additional equipment if ROI positive
- Optimize based on experience

### Maximize Automation

**Benefits**:
- Consistent participation
- Optimal timing
- No user intervention
- Higher savings

**Implementation**:
- Automated price monitoring
- Automated device control
- Automated optimization algorithms

### Monitor Performance

**Track**:
- Actual reductions vs. commitments
- Revenue earned
- Costs incurred
- Net benefits

**Optimize**:
- Adjust strategies based on results
- Improve automation
- Increase participation where beneficial
