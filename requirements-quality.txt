# Code Quality Tools for HomeIQ (NUC-Optimized)
# Install with: pip install -r requirements-quality.txt
# Last Updated: January 2025
# 
# Optimized for single-home, NUC deployment:
# - Lightweight tools only
# - Fast execution
# - Minimal resource usage

# ============================================
# ESSENTIAL: Fast & Lightweight (Install First)
# ============================================

# Fast Python linter and formatter (replaces flake8, isort, etc.)
# 10-100x faster than pylint/flake8, minimal memory footprint
ruff>=0.1.0

# Static type checker for Python (optional but recommended)
# Lightweight static analysis, catches bugs early
mypy>=1.7.0

# ============================================
# OPTIONAL: Run Occasionally (Not Every Time)
# ============================================

# Security linter - run weekly/monthly, not on every commit
bandit>=1.7.5

# Dead code detection - run occasionally to clean up
vulture>=2.10

# ============================================
# ALREADY IN USE: Keep Existing Tools
# ============================================

# Code complexity analysis (already configured in scripts)
radon>=6.0.1

# Traditional Python linter (keep as backup, but Ruff is faster)
pylint>=3.0.0

# Code coverage (if not already installed)
coverage>=7.3.0

# ============================================
# SKIPPED: Too Heavy for NUC
# ============================================
# - SonarQube: Requires 2GB+ RAM Docker container (overkill)
# - wily: Trend tracking (nice-to-have, not essential)
# - CodeScene: Enterprise-focused (not needed for single home)
# - plato: Heavy visualization (use simpler tools)

# ============================================
# Notes
# ============================================
# - Start with Ruff and mypy (essential)
# - Add bandit/vulture only if you want them
# - Keep existing radon/pylint for compatibility
# - See docs/CODE_QUALITY_TOOLS_2025.md for usage
