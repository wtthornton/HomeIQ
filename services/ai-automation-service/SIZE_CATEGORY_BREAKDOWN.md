## How Size Categories Work

Size categories are applied **independently** to each home type. This means:
- Each home type gets broken down into small, medium, large, extra-large
- The size category affects device count within the home type's range
- Size multipliers adjust base device counts

## Size Distribution (Applied to ALL Home Types)

| Size Category | Device Range | Percentage | Multiplier |
|---------------|--------------|------------|------------|
| **Small** | 10-20 devices | 30% | 0.6x |
| **Medium** | 20-40 devices | 40% | 1.0x |
| **Large** | 40-60 devices | 20% | 1.5x |
| **Extra-large** | 60-100 devices | 10% | 2.0x |
