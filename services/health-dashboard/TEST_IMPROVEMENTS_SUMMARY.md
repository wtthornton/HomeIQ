2. **Add integration tests** for new features
3. **Implement visual regression testing** for UI consistency
4. **Enhance performance testing** for new functionality

### **Long-term (Epic 3+):**
1. **Complete test coverage** improvements
2. **Advanced testing patterns** implementation
3. **Continuous testing integration** setup
4. **Test automation** and CI/CD improvements

## 💡 **Key Insights**

### **What Worked Well:**
- ✅ **Incremental approach** to test fixes
- ✅ **Focus on critical issues** first
- ✅ **Documentation-driven** problem solving
- ✅ **Maintained development velocity** while improving quality

### **Lessons Learned:**
- 🔍 **Test environment setup** is critical for React 18
- 🔍 **Mock implementations** need to be comprehensive
- 🔍 **Test selectors** should be specific and robust
- 🔍 **Async handling** requires careful attention

### **Best Practices Established:**
- 📝 **Document issues** before fixing them
- 📝 **Fix incrementally** rather than all at once
- 📝 **Maintain development flow** while improving quality
- 📝 **Focus on functionality** over perfect test coverage
