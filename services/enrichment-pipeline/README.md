# Enrichment Pipeline Service

> **‚ö†Ô∏è DEPRECATED - October 2025 (Epic 31)**
>
> This service has been deprecated as part of Epic 31 architectural improvements. The code remains for reference but is **not deployed in production**.
>
> - **Status:** ‚ùå Not Active (deprecated in Epic 31)
> - **Reason:** Simplified architecture - direct writes to InfluxDB
> - **Replacement:** Inline normalization in websocket-ingestion service
> - **Migration:** Epic 31 - Direct InfluxDB writes
> - **Old Port:** 8002 (not in use)
> - **Deprecated:** October 2025

## üìã Historical Purpose

The Enrichment Pipeline was a FastAPI service that provided:
- Event data validation
- Data normalization to standard format
- InfluxDB Line Protocol conversion
- Quality metrics and monitoring
- Batch write optimization

## üîÑ Epic 31 Migration

### Old Architecture (Pre-Epic 31)

```
Home Assistant
    ‚Üì WebSocket
websocket-ingestion (8001)
    ‚Üì HTTP POST /events
enrichment-pipeline (8002)
    ‚îú‚îÄ Validate events
    ‚îú‚îÄ Normalize data
    ‚îú‚îÄ Generate Line Protocol
    ‚îî‚îÄ Write to InfluxDB (8086)
```

### New Architecture (Epic 31)

```
Home Assistant
    ‚Üì WebSocket
websocket-ingestion (8001)
    ‚îú‚îÄ Validate events (inline)
    ‚îú‚îÄ Normalize data (inline)
    ‚îú‚îÄ Device/area lookups (Epic 23.2)
    ‚îú‚îÄ Duration calculation (Epic 23.3)
    ‚îî‚îÄ DIRECT InfluxDB writes
```

## üí° Why Was It Deprecated?

### Reasons for Removal

1. **Simplified Architecture**
   - Removed unnecessary service hop
   - Reduced system complexity
   - Fewer points of failure

2. **Performance Improvements**
   - Eliminated HTTP POST overhead
   - Reduced latency (2-hop ‚Üí 1-hop)
   - Direct batch writes to InfluxDB

3. **Maintenance Reduction**
   - One less service to maintain
   - Simplified deployment
   - Reduced Docker resource usage

4. **Inline Processing**
   - Validation moved to websocket-ingestion
   - Normalization happens in-place
   - Batch processing maintained

### Performance Impact

**Before Epic 31:**
- Event flow: HA ‚Üí WS (8001) ‚Üí Enrichment (8002) ‚Üí InfluxDB
- Total latency: ~50-100ms per event
- Two services to monitor

**After Epic 31:**
- Event flow: HA ‚Üí WS (8001) ‚Üí InfluxDB
- Total latency: ~20-30ms per event
- One less service to monitor

## üîß Migration Guide

### For Developers

If you have code that references the enrichment-pipeline:

**Old Code:**
```python
# DON'T DO THIS - Deprecated pattern
async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
    async with session.post(
        "http://enrichment-pipeline:8002/events",
        json=event_data
    ) as response:
        result = await response.json()
```

**New Code (Epic 31):**
```python
# DO THIS - Direct InfluxDB write
from influxdb_client import Point

point = Point("state_changed") \
    .tag("entity_id", event["entity_id"]) \
    .tag("domain", event["domain"]) \
    .field("state", event["new_state"]) \
    .time(event["timestamp"])

await influx_write_api.write(point)
```

### For Configuration

**Old docker-compose.yml:**
```yaml
enrichment-pipeline:
  build: ./services/enrichment-pipeline
  ports:
    - "8002:8002"
  # REMOVE THIS SERVICE
```

**New docker-compose.yml:**
```yaml
# No enrichment-pipeline service needed
# websocket-ingestion handles everything
websocket-ingestion:
  build: ./services/websocket-ingestion
  ports:
    - "8001:8001"
  environment:
    - INFLUXDB_URL=http://influxdb:8086  # Direct write
```

## üìö Historical Documentation

For historical reference, the enrichment-pipeline provided:

### Endpoints (Deprecated)
- `POST /events` - Process events from websocket-ingestion
- `POST /process-event` - Process single event
- `POST /process-events` - Batch event processing
- `GET /health` - Service health status
- `GET /status` - Service statistics

### Features (Now in websocket-ingestion)
- Event validation ‚úÖ Moved to websocket-ingestion
- Data normalization ‚úÖ Moved to websocket-ingestion
- InfluxDB writes ‚úÖ Direct writes from websocket-ingestion
- Quality metrics ‚úÖ Maintained in websocket-ingestion
- Batch processing ‚úÖ Improved in websocket-ingestion

## üìñ Code Reference

The enrichment-pipeline code is preserved in the repository for:
- Historical reference
- Understanding Epic 31 changes
- Code reuse (validation logic, normalization functions)
- Educational purposes

**Location:** `services/enrichment-pipeline/`

**Key Files:**
- `src/main.py` - FastAPI application (deprecated)
- `src/data_validator.py` - Validation logic (moved to websocket-ingestion)
- `src/data_normalizer.py` - Normalization (moved to websocket-ingestion)

## ‚úÖ Verification

To verify enrichment-pipeline is not running:

```bash
# Check docker-compose.yml
grep -A 5 "enrichment-pipeline:" docker-compose.yml
# Should be commented out or missing

# Check running containers
docker ps | grep enrichment
# Should return nothing

# Check port 8002
curl http://localhost:8002/health
# Should return connection refused
```
