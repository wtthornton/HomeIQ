---

## Pre-Migration Validation

### Checklist

Run these checks **before** starting Phase 2 migrations:

- [ ] ✅ All Phase 1 services are healthy
- [ ] ✅ All migration scripts tested with dry-runs
- [ ] ✅ Backup of critical data created
- [ ] ✅ InfluxDB backups created
- [ ] ✅ Git repository is clean (all changes committed)
- [ ] ✅ Team notified of planned migration window
- [ ] ✅ Monitoring systems operational
- [ ] ✅ Rollback procedures documented and ready

### Pre-Migration Health Check

```bash
# Check all services are running
docker-compose ps

# Check service health endpoints
./scripts/check-all-health.sh

# Verify InfluxDB connectivity
curl http://localhost:8086/health

# Check Git status
git status

# Verify Docker BuildKit enabled
docker buildx version
```

---

## Migration Validation

### Phase A Validation (Low-Risk Test)

**Purpose:** Validate migration scripts work correctly before proceeding

**Test Services:** automation-miner, blueprint-index, ha-setup-service, ha-simulator

#### Step 1: Dry-Run Validation

```bash
# Test orchestrator dry-run
python scripts/phase2-batch-orchestrator.py --phase a --dry-run

# Expected output:
# - No errors
# - All services detected
# - All migrations identified correctly
# - No actual changes made
```

#### Step 2: Execute Phase A

```bash
# Run Phase A migrations
python scripts/phase2-batch-orchestrator.py --phase a
```

#### Step 3: Validate Phase A Results

```bash
# Check results JSON
cat phase2_results_*.json | jq '.["automation-miner"]'

# Expected:
# {
#   "name": "automation-miner",
#   "priority": "LOW",
#   "migrations": {
#     "pytest-asyncio": true
#   },
#   "overall_success": true
# }

# Verify services build
docker-compose build automation-miner blueprint-index ha-setup-service ha-simulator

# Verify services start
docker-compose up -d automation-miner blueprint-index ha-setup-service ha-simulator

# Check health
curl http://localhost:8001/health  # automation-miner
curl http://localhost:8002/health  # blueprint-index
```

#### Step 4: Run Service Tests

```bash
# Run tests for each migrated service
cd domains/blueprints/automation-miner && pytest tests/ -v
cd domains/blueprints/blueprint-index && pytest tests/ -v
cd domains/device-management/ha-setup-service && pytest tests/ -v
cd domains/core-platform/ha-simulator && pytest tests/ -v
```

**Success Criteria for Phase A:**
- [ ] ✅ All 10 services migrated successfully
- [ ] ✅ All services build without errors
- [ ] ✅ All services start successfully
- [ ] ✅ All health endpoints return 200 OK
- [ ] ✅ All service tests pass (100%)
- [ ] ✅ No errors in service logs

**If Phase A fails:** Stop and investigate before proceeding to Phase B.

---

### Phase B-D Validation

Apply same validation process for each phase:

1. **Dry-run first**
2. **Execute phase**
3. **Validate results JSON**
4. **Verify builds**
5. **Verify service health**
6. **Run service tests**
7. **Check logs for errors**

---

## Post-Migration Validation

### Service-Level Validation

For each migrated service:

#### 1. Build Validation

```bash
# Build service
docker-compose build <service-name>

# Expected:
# - No build errors
# - All dependencies installed
# - New library versions detected
```

#### 2. Startup Validation

```bash
# Start service
docker-compose up -d <service-name>

# Wait for startup
sleep 10

# Check running
docker-compose ps | grep <service-name>

# Expected: Status = Up
```

#### 3. Health Endpoint Validation

```bash
# Check health
curl http://localhost:<port>/health

# Expected:
# {
#   "status": "healthy",
#   "service": "<service-name>",
#   "version": "...",
#   "dependencies": {
#     "influxdb": "connected",  # if applicable
#     ...
#   }
# }
```

#### 4. Log Validation

```bash
# Check logs for errors
docker-compose logs --tail=100 <service-name> | grep -i error

# Expected: No ERROR level logs (or only expected errors)
```

#### 5. Functionality Validation

**For pytest-asyncio migrations:**
```bash
# Run async tests
cd services/<service-name>
pytest tests/ -v -k "async"

# Expected: All async tests pass
```

**For tenacity migrations:**
```bash
# Test retry logic (if testable)
# Verify retry decorators work correctly
```

**For MQTT migrations:**
```bash
# Check MQTT connectivity (if service uses MQTT)
# Verify MQTT client initialization
```

**For InfluxDB migrations:**
```bash
# Test InfluxDB writes
curl -X POST http://localhost:<port>/api/test-write

# Verify data in InfluxDB
influx query 'SELECT * FROM test_measurement LIMIT 10'

# Test InfluxDB queries
curl http://localhost:<port>/api/test-query

# Expected: Query returns data successfully
```

---

## Integration Validation

### System-Wide Tests

After all phases complete, run integration tests:

#### 1. Service Communication

```bash
# Test service-to-service communication
./scripts/test-service-communication.sh

# Expected: All services can communicate
```

#### 2. Data Pipeline

```bash
# Test data flow from websocket-ingestion -> InfluxDB -> data-api
# 1. Send test event to websocket-ingestion
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/test-event

# 2. Wait for processing
sleep 5

# 3. Query via data-api
curl http://localhost:8090/api/events?limit=1

# Expected: Test event appears in query results
```

#### 3. End-to-End Workflows

```bash
# Test critical workflows:
# - Event ingestion -> processing -> storage -> query
# - API automation trigger -> execution -> result
# - Data retention -> cleanup -> archive

./scripts/test-e2e-workflows.sh
```

#### 4. Performance Validation

```bash
# Compare performance before/after migration
# - Query latency
# - Write throughput
# - CPU/memory usage

./scripts/compare-performance.sh
```

---

## Rollback Validation

### Test Rollback Procedures

**Important:** Test rollback on a non-critical service first.

#### 1. Select Test Service

```bash
# Use a low-risk service for testing
TEST_SERVICE="air-quality-service"
```

#### 2. Record Current State

```bash
# Check current version
docker-compose exec $TEST_SERVICE python -c "import influxdb_client_3; print(influxdb_client_3.__version__)"

# Save current health status
curl http://localhost:<port>/health > health_before_rollback.json
```

#### 3. Execute Rollback

```bash
cd services/$TEST_SERVICE

# List rollback scripts
ls -la rollback_*.sh

# Execute rollback (most recent)
./rollback_influxdb_*.sh

# Expected output:
# [OK] Restored requirements.txt
# [OK] Restored src directory
# [OK] Rollback complete
```

#### 4. Verify Rollback

```bash
# Rebuild with old versions
docker-compose build $TEST_SERVICE

# Restart service
docker-compose up -d $TEST_SERVICE

# Verify old version
docker-compose exec $TEST_SERVICE python -c "import influxdb_client; print(influxdb_client.__version__)"

# Expected: Old version (e.g., 1.49.0)

# Check health
curl http://localhost:<port>/health

# Compare with before rollback
diff health_before_rollback.json <(curl -s http://localhost:<port>/health)

# Expected: Service healthy, same functionality
```

#### 5. Re-Migrate After Test

```bash
# Re-run migration to restore Phase 2 state
python scripts/phase2-migrate-influxdb.py $TEST_SERVICE
```

**Rollback Test Success Criteria:**
- [ ] ✅ Rollback script executes without errors
- [ ] ✅ Old library versions restored
- [ ] ✅ Service builds successfully
- [ ] ✅ Service starts successfully
- [ ] ✅ Health endpoint returns healthy
- [ ] ✅ Service functionality unchanged
- [ ] ✅ Re-migration works after rollback

## Failure Scenarios & Recovery

### Scenario 1: Migration Script Fails

**Symptoms:**
- Script exits with error code
- Service marked as failed in results JSON
- Error logged

**Recovery:**
1. Check error message in results JSON or logs
2. Review migration script output
3. Fix underlying issue (e.g., missing dependency, syntax error)
4. Re-run migration for that service
5. Verify success

**Example:**
```bash
# Check error
cat phase2_results_*.json | jq '.["failed-service"]'

# Re-run specific migration
python scripts/phase2-migrate-influxdb.py failed-service

# Verify
docker-compose build failed-service
docker-compose up -d failed-service
curl http://localhost:<port>/health
```

### Scenario 2: Service Fails to Build

**Symptoms:**
- Docker build exits with error
- Dependency installation fails
- Import errors

**Recovery:**
1. Check build logs
2. Verify requirements.txt syntax
3. Check for conflicting dependencies
4. Rollback if needed
5. Fix and retry

**Example:**
```bash
# Check build logs
docker-compose build failed-service 2>&1 | tee build_error.log

# Common issues:
# - Syntax error in requirements.txt
# - Version conflict
# - Missing dependency

# Rollback
cd services/failed-service
./rollback_*.sh

# Fix requirements.txt
vim requirements.txt

# Retry build
docker-compose build failed-service
```

### Scenario 3: Service Fails Health Check

**Symptoms:**
- Service starts but health endpoint returns 500
- Service crashes on startup
- Dependency connection errors

**Recovery:**
1. Check service logs
2. Verify all dependencies are migrated correctly
3. Check for API changes requiring manual code updates
4. Fix code and rebuild

**Example:**
```bash
# Check logs
docker-compose logs --tail=100 failed-service

# Common issues for InfluxDB migration:
# - Old client initialization API used
# - Missing database parameter
# - Flux query instead of SQL

# Fix code (manual)
vim services/failed-service/src/influxdb_client.py

# Rebuild and restart
docker-compose build failed-service
docker-compose up -d failed-service
```

### Scenario 4: Tests Fail After Migration

**Symptoms:**
- pytest exits with failures
- Test coverage drops
- Integration tests fail

**Recovery:**
1. Identify failing tests
2. Check if tests need updates for new APIs
3. Fix test code
4. Re-run tests

**Example:**
```bash
# Run tests with verbose output
cd services/failed-service
pytest tests/ -v --tb=short

# Common issues:
# - Test fixtures need @pytest.mark.asyncio
# - Mock objects need updating for new API
# - Async context managers changed

# Fix tests
vim tests/test_something.py

# Re-run
pytest tests/ -v
```
