## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Changes

### Before (Monolithic)
```
AI Automation Service
‚îú‚îÄ Local model loading
‚îú‚îÄ Memory-intensive operations
‚îú‚îÄ Single point of failure
‚îî‚îÄ Difficult to scale
```

### After (Containerized)
```
AI Automation Service (Port 8017)
    ‚Üì HTTP API calls
AI Core Service (Port 8018)
    ‚îú‚îÄ OpenVINO Service (Port 8019) - Embeddings, re-ranking
    ‚îú‚îÄ ML Service (Port 8020) - Clustering, anomaly detection
    ‚îú‚îÄ NER Service (Port 8019) - Entity extraction
    ‚îî‚îÄ OpenAI Service (Port 8020) - Language processing
```

## üîß Key Technical Fixes

### 1. Health Check Resolution
**Problem:** Docker Compose health checks failing because containers didn't have `curl`  
**Solution:** Updated all health checks to use Python `urllib.request` instead of `curl`

### 2. Dependency Compatibility
**Problem:** OpenVINO dependency conflicts with `optimum-intel` and `transformers`  
**Solution:** Used standard models with compatible versions, disabled OpenVINO optimization temporarily

### 3. Port Management
**Problem:** Port conflicts between services (8019 used by both NER and OpenVINO)  
**Solution:** Mapped OpenVINO service to external port 8022

### 4. NumPy Compatibility
**Problem:** `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'norm'` error  
**Solution:** Implemented custom normalization using `np.linalg.norm()`

## üìä Performance Benefits

### Resource Management
- **Memory Isolation**: Each AI model runs in its own container
- **CPU Optimization**: Models can be scaled independently
- **Fault Tolerance**: Service failures don't affect other AI services
- **Resource Limits**: Proper memory and CPU limits per service

### Scalability
- **Independent Scaling**: Scale individual services based on demand
- **Service Discovery**: HTTP-based communication enables load balancing
- **Health Monitoring**: Comprehensive health checks for all services
- **Circuit Breaker**: Prevents cascade failures

## üß™ Testing Results

### Service Health Tests
```
‚úÖ ml_service: healthy
‚úÖ openvino_service: healthy  
‚úÖ ner_service: healthy
