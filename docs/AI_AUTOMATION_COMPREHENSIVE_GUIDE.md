## Features

### ‚ú® Natural Language Generation (AI1.21)

**What:** Create automations from plain English  
**How:** Type request ‚Üí AI generates YAML ‚Üí You approve ‚Üí Deploys to HA  
**Examples:**
- "Turn on porch light when motion detected after dark"
- "Close blinds at sunset"
- "Send notification when door left open 5 minutes"

**Behind the Scenes:**
- Fetches your actual devices from Home Assistant
- Uses OpenAI GPT-4o-mini to generate valid YAML
- Validates syntax automatically
- Retries if generation fails

---

### üõ°Ô∏è Safety Validation (AI1.19)

**What:** 6-rule engine that blocks dangerous automations  
**When:** Runs automatically before every deployment  
**Score:** 0-100 (must be ‚â•60 to deploy)

**Blocks:**
1. ‚ùå Extreme temperatures (>85¬∞F or <55¬∞F)
2. ‚ùå "Turn off all" patterns
3. ‚ùå Disabling security/alarm automations
4. ‚ùå System-level calls (restart, reload)

**Warns:**
5. ‚ö†Ô∏è Destructive actions without time constraints
6. ‚ö†Ô∏è High-frequency triggers (every minute)

**Results:**
- Safe automation ‚Üí Deploys with score shown
- Unsafe automation ‚Üí Blocked with detailed issues

---

### ‚è™ Simple Rollback (AI1.20)

**What:** Undo automations that don't work  
**How:** One-click rollback to previous version  
**Storage:** Last 3 versions per automation

**When to Use:**
- Automation triggers too often
- Automation doesn't work as expected
- Want to test changes safely

**How It Works:**
1. Click "‚è™ Rollback to Previous Version"
2. Enter reason (optional)
3. Previous version restored in HA
4. Safety validated before restore

---

### üìä Pattern Detection (AI1.4-1.6)

**What:** Daily analysis finds automation opportunities  
**When:** Runs daily at 3 AM  
**Detects:**
- Time-of-day patterns (consistent usage times)
- Co-occurrence patterns (devices used together)
- Anomaly patterns (repeated manual interventions)

**Results:**
- 5-10 suggestions per week
- Appears in same AI Automations tab
- Same approve/deploy workflow

## User Guide

### Creating Automations with Natural Language

**Step 1: Write Your Request**

Be specific about:
- **Device:** Which device(s) to control
- **Action:** What should happen
- **Trigger:** When it should happen
- **Condition (optional):** Any special conditions

**Good Examples:**
- ‚úÖ "Turn on kitchen light at 7 AM on weekdays"
- ‚úÖ "Turn off heater when any window is open for 10 minutes"
- ‚úÖ "Send notification when front door left open 5 minutes"
- ‚úÖ "Close all blinds at sunset"

**Bad Examples:**
- ‚ùå "Turn on light" (which light? when?)
- ‚ùå "Do something with temperature" (too vague)
- ‚ùå "Make it comfortable" (AI needs specifics)

**Step 2: Review Generated Automation**

Check:
- ‚úÖ Uses correct device names
- ‚úÖ Trigger makes sense
- ‚úÖ Action is what you want
- ‚úÖ Safety score is high (‚â•80 is excellent)

**Step 3: Deploy**

- Click "‚úÖ Approve & Deploy"
- System validates safety
- If safe: Deploys to Home Assistant
- If unsafe: Shows specific issues to fix

---

### Understanding Safety Scores

| Score | Meaning | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| **90-100** | ‚úÖ Excellent - No issues | Deploy with confidence |
| **70-89** | ‚ö†Ô∏è Good - Minor warnings | Review warnings, usually safe to deploy |
| **60-69** | ‚ö†Ô∏è Acceptable - Some concerns | Review carefully before deploying |
| **40-59** | ‚ùå Risky - Multiple issues | Fix issues before deploying |
| **0-39** | ‚ùå Dangerous - Critical issues | Do not deploy, rethink automation |

**Note:** Score <60 blocks deployment (configurable)

---

### Using Rollback

**When Automation Misbehaves:**

1. Go to AI Automations tab
2. Change filter to "Deployed"
3. Find the automation
4. Click "‚è™ Rollback to Previous Version"
5. Enter reason (helps you remember why)
6. Previous version restored

**Limitations:**
- Need at least 2 versions (can't rollback first deployment)
- Previous version must pass current safety checks
- Only keeps last 3 versions

---

### Using Pattern Suggestions

**Daily at 3 AM:**
- AI analyzes last 30 days of usage
- Detects patterns in your behavior
- Generates 5-10 automation suggestions

**Review Process:**
1. Open AI Automations tab in morning
2. See new "Pending" suggestions
3. Review each one
4. Approve useful ones, reject others

**Approval Rate:**
- Target: >60% approval rate
- If lower: Patterns may not be relevant
- Can adjust confidence threshold

### Safety Levels Explained

**Strict (score ‚â•80):**
- Most restrictive
- Blocks anything questionable
- Best for: Families with children, production systems

**Moderate (score ‚â•60) - DEFAULT:**
- Balanced approach
- Blocks critical issues, warns on concerns
- Best for: Most users

**Permissive (score ‚â•40):**
- Most lenient
- Allows more automations through
- Best for: Power users, testing environments

**Change Level:**
```bash
# In infrastructure/env.ai-automation
SAFETY_LEVEL=strict    # or moderate, or permissive
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### NL Generation Fails

**Symptom:** "Failed to generate automation"

**Possible Causes:**
1. OpenAI API key invalid or no credits
2. Network issues reaching OpenAI
3. data-api not responding (can't fetch devices)

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Check OpenAI key
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/models \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY"

# Check data-api
curl http://localhost:8006/health

# Check ai-automation-service logs
docker-compose logs ai-automation-service | Select-String "error"
```

---

### Safety Validation Too Strict

**Symptom:** Safe automations getting blocked

**Solutions:**
1. **Lower safety level** to "permissive"
2. **Review specific issues** (may be legitimate concerns)
3. **Use force_deploy** for specific automation

```bash
# In env.ai-automation
SAFETY_LEVEL=permissive
SAFETY_MIN_SCORE=40
```

---

### Can't Deploy to Home Assistant

**Symptom:** "Deployment failed" or "HA API error"

**Possible Causes:**
1. HA token expired
2. HA not accessible at configured URL
3. HA automation reload service unavailable

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Test HA connection
curl http://192.168.1.86:8123/api/ \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"

# Generate new token in HA
# Profile ‚Üí Long-Lived Access Tokens ‚Üí Create Token

# Update in env.ai-automation
HA_TOKEN=<new-token>
```

---

### Rollback Not Working

**Symptom:** "No previous version available"

**Cause:** First deployment (no history yet)

**Solution:** Deploy automation at least twice before rollback available

---

**Symptom:** "Previous version fails safety checks"

**Cause:** Safety rules changed since original deployment

**Solution:** Edit and redeploy instead of rollback

---

| Deployment | 1-2s | <2s | ‚úÖ Good |
| Rollback | <1s | <2s | ‚úÖ Excellent |

---

## Best Practices

### Writing Good NL Requests

**Do:**
- ‚úÖ Be specific: "Turn on **kitchen** light at **7 AM**"
- ‚úÖ Include timing: "at 7 AM", "after sunset", "when motion detected"
- ‚úÖ Use actual device names from your HA
- ‚úÖ Start simple, add complexity later

**Don't:**
- ‚ùå Be vague: "Turn on light" (which one?)
- ‚ùå Use devices you don't have
- ‚ùå Combine too many actions in one request
- ‚ùå Request dangerous operations

---

### Safety Considerations

**Always Review:**
- Generated YAML before approving
- Safety score and warnings
- Devices and triggers used

**Never:**
- Override safety on critical security issues
- Deploy without reviewing YAML
- Ignore safety warnings

**Test First:**
- Create automation
- Monitor for one day
- Rollback if issues
- Adjust and redeploy

---

## Testing Checklist

### Before Production Use

- [ ] Test NL generation with 5 different requests
- [ ] Verify at least 1 deploys successfully to HA
- [ ] Confirm deployed automation actually triggers
- [ ] Test rollback functionality
- [ ] Review safety validation with unsafe request
- [ ] Check OpenAI costs after testing
- [ ] Verify mobile experience (if using phone)

### Weekly Monitoring

- [ ] Check pattern suggestions quality
- [ ] Review approval rate
- [ ] Monitor OpenAI costs
- [ ] Check for any misbehaving automations
- [ ] Review rollback frequency

---
