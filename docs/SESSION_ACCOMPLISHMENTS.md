## 🎨 Key Design Decisions

### 1. Team Selection is MANDATORY ⭐
**Problem:** Fetching all 32 NFL + 32 NHL teams would:
- Exceed API rate limits (100 calls/day free tier)
- Slow down dashboard
- Show irrelevant data

**Solution:**
- User must select teams during setup
- API only fetches selected teams
- ~12 calls/day per team = manageable
- 3-5 teams recommended for optimal UX

**Benefits:**
- Stays within free tier
- Faster performance
- Personalized experience
- Lower costs

### 2. Animated Dependencies Tab 🌊
**Problem:** Dependencies tab was static and boring

**Solution:** Real-time animated visualization with:
- Flowing data particles (Context7 KB: React Flow patterns)
- Pulsing nodes when active
- Color-coded flows by type
- Interactive highlighting
- Live throughput metrics

**Benefits:**
- Users actually understand data flow
- System health visible at a glance
- Engaging and delightful
- Professional appearance

### 3. Mobile-First Responsive Design
- Works on phones, tablets, desktops
- Touch-friendly interactions
- Adaptive layouts
- Swipe gestures
