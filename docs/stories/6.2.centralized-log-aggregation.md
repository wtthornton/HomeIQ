# Story 6.2: Centralized Log Aggregation

## Status
Draft

## Story

**As a** system administrator and operations team,  
**I want** all service logs to be aggregated into a centralized system with search and filtering capabilities,  
**so that** I can efficiently search, analyze, and troubleshoot issues across all services from a single interface.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **AC1: Centralized Log Collection** - All service logs are collected and stored in a centralized system accessible from a single interface
2. **AC2: Log Search and Filtering** - Ability to search logs by service, time range, log level, correlation ID, and custom fields
3. **AC3: Real-time Log Streaming** - Real-time log streaming and monitoring capabilities for immediate issue detection
4. **AC4: Log Retention Policies** - Configurable log retention policies with automatic cleanup and archival
5. **AC5: Log Storage Management** - Efficient log storage with compression, indexing, and storage optimization
6. **AC6: Log Analysis Dashboard** - Web-based dashboard for log analysis, visualization, and reporting
7. **AC7: Log Export and Backup** - Ability to export logs and create backups for compliance and analysis
8. **AC8: Log Aggregation Monitoring** - Monitoring and alerting for log aggregation system health and performance

## Dev Notes

### Current Log Aggregation State

**Existing Foundation:**
- ✅ Docker Compose infrastructure for service orchestration
- ✅ Basic logging framework in services
- ✅ Docker logging drivers available
- ✅ InfluxDB available for metrics storage

**Current Logging Architecture:**
```
Services → Individual Log Files → Manual Analysis
    ↓           ↓                    ↓
  Docker     Local Files         Troubleshooting
  Logs       (scattered)         (manual process)
```

**Target Log Aggregation Architecture:**
```
Services → Structured Logs → Log Aggregation → Centralized Storage → Analysis Dashboard
    ↓           ↓              ↓                ↓                    ↓
  JSON      Logstash/      Elasticsearch     Kibana/Grafana      Search/Filter
  Format    Fluentd        Storage           Visualization        Analysis
```

### Implementation Strategy

**Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup**
1. Set up ELK stack or alternative (Fluentd + Elasticsearch + Kibana)
2. Configure Docker services for log aggregation
3. Set up log collection and routing

**Phase 2: Search and Analysis**
1. Implement search and filtering capabilities
2. Create log analysis dashboard
3. Add real-time monitoring and alerting

**Phase 3: Storage and Management**
1. Implement retention policies and storage optimization
2. Set up backup and export functionality
3. Add monitoring and performance optimization

### Technology Stack Options

**Option 1: ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)**
- **Pros**: Full-featured, powerful search, mature ecosystem
- **Cons**: Resource-intensive, complex setup
- **Use Case**: Full-featured log analysis and visualization

**Option 2: Fluentd + Elasticsearch + Kibana**
- **Pros**: Lightweight, flexible, good performance
- **Cons**: Additional configuration complexity
- **Use Case**: High-performance log collection

**Option 3: Loki + Grafana (Lightweight Alternative)**
- **Pros**: Lightweight, efficient, Grafana integration
- **Cons**: Less powerful than Elasticsearch
- **Use Case**: Simple log aggregation with basic analysis

**Recommended**: ELK Stack for comprehensive log analysis capabilities
