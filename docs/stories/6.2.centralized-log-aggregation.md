# Story 6.2: Centralized Log Aggregation

## Status
Draft

## Story

**As a** system administrator and operations team,  
**I want** all service logs to be aggregated into a centralized system with search and filtering capabilities,  
**so that** I can efficiently search, analyze, and troubleshoot issues across all services from a single interface.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **AC1: Centralized Log Collection** - All service logs are collected and stored in a centralized system accessible from a single interface
2. **AC2: Log Search and Filtering** - Ability to search logs by service, time range, log level, correlation ID, and custom fields
3. **AC3: Real-time Log Streaming** - Real-time log streaming and monitoring capabilities for immediate issue detection
4. **AC4: Log Retention Policies** - Configurable log retention policies with automatic cleanup and archival
5. **AC5: Log Storage Management** - Efficient log storage with compression, indexing, and storage optimization
6. **AC6: Log Analysis Dashboard** - Web-based dashboard for log analysis, visualization, and reporting
7. **AC7: Log Export and Backup** - Ability to export logs and create backups for compliance and analysis
8. **AC8: Log Aggregation Monitoring** - Monitoring and alerting for log aggregation system health and performance

## Dev Notes

### Current State
**Foundation**: Docker Compose infrastructure, basic logging framework, Docker logging drivers

**Target Architecture**: Services → Structured Logs → ELK Stack → Centralized Storage → Analysis Dashboard

### Implementation Strategy
1. **Infrastructure Setup**: ELK stack configuration and Docker services
2. **Search and Analysis**: Search capabilities and log analysis dashboard  
3. **Storage Management**: Retention policies and backup functionality

### Technology Choice
**Recommended**: ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for comprehensive log analysis

### Source Tree Information

**New Files to Create:**
- `infrastructure/elk-stack/` - ELK stack configuration
- `infrastructure/logstash/` - Logstash configuration
- `infrastructure/kibana/` - Kibana configuration
- `infrastructure/elasticsearch/` - Elasticsearch configuration
- `scripts/log-aggregation/` - Log aggregation scripts

**Files to Modify:**
- `docker-compose.yml` - Add log aggregation services
- `docker-compose.dev.yml` - Development log aggregation
- `docker-compose.prod.yml` - Production log aggregation
- `infrastructure/env.example` - Log aggregation environment variables

### Docker Configuration

**Docker Compose Addition:**
```yaml
services:
  elasticsearch:
    image: docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:8.11.0
    environment:
      - discovery.type=single-node
      - xpack.security.enabled=false
    ports:
      - "9200:9200"
    volumes:
      - elasticsearch_data:/usr/share/elasticsearch/data

  logstash:
    image: docker.elastic.co/logstash/logstash:8.11.0
    volumes:
      - ./infrastructure/logstash/pipeline:/usr/share/logstash/pipeline
      - ./infrastructure/logstash/config:/usr/share/logstash/config
    ports:
      - "5044:5044"
    depends_on:
      - elasticsearch

  kibana:
    image: docker.elastic.co/kibana/kibana:8.11.0
    environment:
      - ELASTICSEARCH_HOSTS=http://elasticsearch:9200
    ports:
      - "5601:5601"
    depends_on:
      - elasticsearch

volumes:
  elasticsearch_data:
```

**Log Driver Configuration:**
```yaml
services:
  websocket-ingestion:
    logging:
      driver: "json-file"
      options:
        max-size: "100m"
        max-file: "5"
        labels: "service=websocket-ingestion"
```

### Configuration Requirements
**Environment Variables**: LOG_AGGREGATION_ENABLED, ELASTICSEARCH_URL, KIBANA_URL, LOG_RETENTION_DAYS

### Key Features
- Full-text search across all log fields
- Service-specific search and time range filtering
- Correlation ID tracing and custom field filtering
- Log volume visualization and error rate trends

### Performance & Security
- Asynchronous log collection with batching
- Elasticsearch optimization and retention policies
- Secure transmission and access control
- Data sanitization for sensitive information
