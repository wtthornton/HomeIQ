# Story 11.2: Team Selection UI & User Preferences

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** dashboard user,

4. Step 3: Review selections with estimated API usage calculator
5. Empty state shown when no teams selected with helpful prompts
6. Team management interface to add/remove teams after setup
7. Selected teams stored in localStorage (Phase 1)
8. API usage estimate displayed (teams × 12 calls/day)
9. Warning when selecting >8 teams (approaching rate limits)
10. Mobile-responsive design with touch-friendly team cards

### Technology Stack
- **UI Framework:** React 18.2 + TypeScript
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (existing)
- **State Management:** React hooks (useState, useEffect)
- **Storage:** localStorage (Phase 1)
- **HTTP:** fetch API
- **Icons:** Emoji or existing icon set

### Integration Points
- Calls `/api/sports/teams` via Nginx proxy
- Saves to localStorage key: `sports_selected_teams`
- Passes selected teams to LiveGameCard components
- Integrates with existing Dashboard dark mode
- Uses existing responsive breakpoints

### UI Patterns (Match Existing Dashboard)
```typescript
// Use existing Tailwind patterns
const cardClasses = darkMode 
  ? 'bg-gray-800 text-white' 
  : 'bg-white text-gray-900';

// Follow existing button styles
const buttonClasses = darkMode
  ? 'bg-blue-600 hover:bg-blue-700'
  : 'bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-600';
```

### Local Storage Schema
```typescript
interface StoredPreferences {
  nfl_teams: string[];      // ['sf', 'dal', 'gb']
  nhl_teams: string[];      // ['bos', 'wsh']
  setup_completed: boolean;
  last_updated: string;     // ISO timestamp
  version: number;          // For migration
}
```

### API Usage Calculation
```typescript
function calculateAPIUsage(nflTeams: string[], nhlTeams: string[]): {
  daily_calls: number;
  within_free_tier: boolean;
  warning_level: 'safe' | 'caution' | 'danger';
} {
  const calls_per_team = 12; // Average per day
  const free_tier_limit = 100;
  
  const total = (nflTeams.length + nhlTeams.length) * calls_per_team;
  
  return {
    daily_calls: total,
    within_free_tier: total <= free_tier_limit,
    warning_level: total > 95 ? 'danger' : total > 80 ? 'caution' : 'safe'
  };
}
```

### Testing

**Test Framework:** Vitest (if available) or Jest
**Test Location:** `services/health-dashboard/src/__tests__/`
**E2E Tests:** Playwright in `services/health-dashboard/tests/e2e/`

**Test Standards:**
- Component tests with React Testing Library
- Hook tests with @testing-library/react-hooks
- localStorage mocking
- E2E test complete wizard flow

**Example Test:**
```typescript
test('team selection updates localStorage', async () => {
  const { result } = renderHook(() => useTeamPreferences());
  
  act(() => {
    result.current.addTeam('nfl', 'sf');
  });
  
  const stored = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('sports_selected_teams')!);
  expect(stored.nfl_teams).toContain('sf');
});
```

### Mobile Considerations
- Wizard step transitions with swipe gestures
- Bottom navigation for steps on mobile
- Touch targets minimum 44×44px
- Test on both iOS Safari and Android Chrome
- Consider PWA manifest for "Add to Home Screen"

### Accessibility
- Keyboard navigation for wizard
- ARIA labels for team cards
- Focus management in modal
- Screen reader announcements for selections
- Color contrast (WCAG AA minimum)
