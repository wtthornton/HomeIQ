# Story 1.5: Modern UI Design and Styling

## Story Overview

**As a** system administrator,  
**I want** a modern, visually appealing dashboard interface,  
**so that** I can quickly understand system status and enjoy using the monitoring tool.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Modern design system with improved visual hierarchy is implemented
2. Enhanced color scheme and typography for better readability
3. Improved spacing, shadows, and visual effects for modern look
4. Consistent iconography and visual elements throughout
5. Dark/light theme support with smooth transitions

## Integration Verification

**IV1**: All existing functionality remains visually consistent  
**IV2**: New styling doesn't break existing component layouts  
**IV3**: Theme switching works seamlessly across all components

## Technical Requirements

### Design System Enhancement
- Extend existing Tailwind CSS v3.4.0 design system
- Implement consistent color palette using CSS custom properties:
  ```css
  :root {
    --color-primary: #3B82F6;
    --color-secondary: #6B7280;
    --color-success: #10B981;
    --color-warning: #F59E0B;
    --color-error: #EF4444;
  }
  ```
- Create component styling guidelines with Tailwind utilities
- Implement theme switching with CSS custom properties:
  ```css
  [data-theme="dark"] {
    --color-primary: #60A5FA;
    --color-background: #1F2937;
    --color-text: #F9FAFB;
  }
  ```
- Ensure accessibility compliance with new styling (WCAG 2.1 AA)

### Visual Hierarchy
- Improve information architecture through visual design
- Implement consistent spacing and layout patterns
- Add visual emphasis for important information
- Ensure clear data presentation and readability

### Theme System
- Implement dark/light theme support
- Create theme switching mechanism
- Ensure all components support both themes
- Implement smooth theme transitions

### Component Styling
- Update existing components with modern styling
- Implement consistent shadows and visual effects
- Add hover states and interactive feedback
- Ensure responsive design across all components

### Iconography
- Implement consistent icon system using Heroicons
- Ensure icons are accessible and properly sized
- Add icon animations and transitions
- Maintain icon consistency across themes
