## 📊 Detailed Requirements

### 1. Enhanced Health Endpoints
**Enhanced Health Response Structure:**
```python
@dataclass
class HealthStatus:
    service: str
    status: str  # healthy, unhealthy, degraded
    timestamp: datetime
    uptime_seconds: int
    version: str
    dependencies: Dict[str, str]  # service -> status
    performance_metrics: Dict[str, float]
    last_error: Optional[str]
    details: Dict[str, Any]
```

**Example Enhanced Health Response:**
```json
{
  "service": "enrichment-pipeline",
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-12T22:58:40Z",
  "uptime_seconds": 86400,

    "events_processed_per_minute": 45,
    "memory_usage_mb": 128.5,
    "cpu_usage_percent": 12.3
  },
  "last_error": null,
  "details": {
    "active_connections": 3,
    "queue_size": 0,

**Dependency Health Check:**
```python
class DependencyMonitor:
    def check_influxdb_health(self) -> str:
        """Check InfluxDB connection and performance"""
        try:
            # Test connection
            client = InfluxDBClient(url=INFLUXDB_URL, token=INFLUXDB_TOKEN)
            result = client.ping()
            
            # Test query performance
            start_time = time.time()
            client.query_api().query("SHOW DATABASES")
            query_time = time.time() - start_time
            
            if query_time > 5.0:
                return "degraded"
            elif result:
                return "healthy"
            else:
                return "unhealthy"
        except Exception:
            return "unhealthy"
```

### 4. Health Status Aggregation
**Health Aggregator Service:**
```python
class HealthAggregator:
    def get_overall_health(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Get aggregated health status across all services"""
        service_health = {}
        overall_status = "healthy"
        
        for service in SERVICES:
            health = self.get_service_health(service)
            service_health[service] = health
            
            # Determine overall status
            if health.status == "unhealthy":
                overall_status = "unhealthy"
            elif health.status == "degraded" and overall_status == "healthy":
                overall_status = "degraded"
        
        return {
            "overall_status": overall_status,
            "timestamp": datetime.utcnow().isoformat(),
            "services": service_health,
            "summary": self.calculate_health_summary(service_health)
        }
```
