# Story DI-2.1: Parallel Service Operation

**Story ID:** DI-2.1  
**Epic:** DI-2 (Device Intelligence Migration & Integration)  
**Status:** Review  
**Priority:** P0  
**Story Points:** 5  
**Complexity:** Medium

        self.new_system_active = True
        self.data_sync_enabled = True
        self.conflict_resolution = "new_system_wins"
    
    async def start_parallel_operation(self):
        """Start both old and new systems in parallel"""
        # Start old system (existing services)
        await self._start_old_system()

        # Merge and resolve conflicts
        merged_devices = await self._merge_device_data(old_devices, new_devices)
        
        # Write to shared database
        await self._write_shared_devices(merged_devices)
    
    async def _merge_device_data(self, old_devices, new_devices):
        """Merge device data with conflict resolution"""
        merged = {}
        
        # Add old system devices
        for device in old_devices:
            merged[device.id] = device
        
        # Add/update with new system devices
        for device in new_devices:
            if device.id in merged:
                # Resolve conflicts (new system wins)
                merged[device.id] = device
            else:
                merged[device.id] = device
        
        return list(merged.values())
```

```python
# src/core/conflict_resolution.py
class ConflictResolver:
    def __init__(self):
        self.resolution_strategy = "new_system_wins"
    
    async def resolve_device_conflict(self, old_device, new_device):
        """Resolve conflicts between old and new device data"""
        if self.resolution_strategy == "new_system_wins":
            return new_device
        elif self.resolution_strategy == "old_system_wins":
            return old_device
        elif self.resolution_strategy == "merge":
            return await self._merge_device_data(old_device, new_device)
    
    async def _merge_device_data(self, old_device, new_device):
        """Merge device data intelligently"""
        merged = old_device.copy()
        
        # Update with new data where available
        for key, value in new_device.items():
            if value is not None:
                merged[key] = value
        
        return merged
```

### Performance Monitoring

# src/core/performance_monitor.py
class PerformanceMonitor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.metrics = {}
        self.old_system_metrics = {}
        self.new_system_metrics = {}
    
    async def monitor_parallel_operation(self):
        """Monitor performance of both systems"""
        while True:
            # Monitor old system
            old_metrics = await self._get_old_system_metrics()
            self.old_system_metrics = old_metrics
            
            # Monitor new system
            new_metrics = await self._get_new_system_metrics()
            self.new_system_metrics = new_metrics
            
            # Compare performance
            comparison = await self._compare_performance(old_metrics, new_metrics)
            
            # Log results
            await self._log_performance_comparison(comparison)
            
            await asyncio.sleep(60)  # Monitor every minute
    
    async def _compare_performance(self, old_metrics, new_metrics):
        """Compare performance between old and new systems"""
        return {
            "query_time_improvement": new_metrics["avg_query_time"] / old_metrics["avg_query_time"],
            "memory_usage_comparison": new_metrics["memory_usage"] / old_metrics["memory_usage"],

### Technical Implementation

**Files Modified:**
- `src/clients/device_intelligence_client.py` - New client for Device Intelligence Service
- `src/config.py` - Added device_intelligence_url configuration
- `src/device_intelligence/feature_analyzer.py` - Updated to use Device Intelligence Service

### Next Steps

The parallel operation phase is complete. The system is ready for:
1. Device Intelligence Service to discover devices from Home Assistant
2. Gradual migration of dependent services to use Device Intelligence Service
3. Eventual decommissioning of old device discovery in ai-automation-service

**Story DI-2.1 is ready for QA review and approval.**
