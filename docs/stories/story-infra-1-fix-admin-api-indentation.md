# Story INFRA-1: Fix Admin API Indentation Error

**Epic:** Infrastructure Maintenance  
**Story ID:** INFRA-1  
**Priority:** High  
**Effort:** 2 Story Points  
**Status:** ✅ Complete  

## User Story

**As a** system administrator  
**I want** the Admin API service to start successfully  
**So that** I can access system statistics and metrics through the admin interface

## Problem Statement

The Admin API service fails to start due to a Python syntax error in `stats_endpoints.py`. Route decorator methods (`@self.router.get`) are defined outside the `_add_routes()` method scope, causing a `NameError: name 'self' is not defined` at module load time.

### Current Error
```python
# services/admin-api/src/stats_endpoints.py
class StatsEndpoints:
    def _add_routes(self):
        # ... routes defined here (lines 79-195)
        
    # ❌ ERROR: These routes are outside _add_routes() method
    @self.router.get("/event-rate", response_model=Dict[str, Any])  # Line 628
    async def get_event_rate():
        """Get standardized event rate metrics"""
        try:  # Wrong indentation
            # ...
```

### Service Impact
```
Container: ha-ingestor-admin (unhealthy)
Error: NameError: name 'self' is not defined
Location: /app/src/stats_endpoints.py:628
Impact: Admin API unavailable, statistics endpoints inaccessible
```

## Acceptance Criteria

### Must Have
- [ ] All route decorators are properly scoped within `_add_routes()` method
- [ ] Correct indentation for all route handler functions
- [ ] Admin API container starts successfully and reports healthy
- [ ] All statistics endpoints respond correctly:
  - `GET /stats` - General statistics
  - `GET /stats/services` - Service statistics  
  - `GET /stats/metrics` - Metrics data
  - `GET /stats/performance` - Performance stats
  - `GET /stats/alerts` - Active alerts
  - `GET /event-rate` - Event rate metrics
  - `GET /real-time-metrics` - Real-time metrics

### Should Have
- [ ] No linter errors or warnings
- [ ] Type hints maintained for all functions
- [ ] Docstrings preserved for all routes
- [ ] Code formatting follows PEP 8 standards

### Nice to Have
- [ ] Additional unit tests for endpoint functions
- [ ] Integration test for full stats workflow
- [ ] Performance benchmarks documented

## Technical Details

### Files to Modify
1. **`services/admin-api/src/stats_endpoints.py`** (Primary)
   - Fix indentation for routes starting at line 628
   - Ensure all routes are within `_add_routes()` method scope
   - Verify proper nesting of try/except blocks

### Root Cause Analysis
The routes at lines 628+ were likely added during a refactoring session and accidentally placed outside the `_add_routes()` method. The decorator `@self.router.get` requires access to `self`, which is only available within instance methods.

### Code Structure
```python
class StatsEndpoints:
    def __init__(self):
        self.router = APIRouter()
        self._add_routes()  # Routes registered here
    
    def _add_routes(self):
        """Add all statistics routes"""
        
        # ✅ CORRECT: Routes defined inside method
        @self.router.get("/stats")
        async def get_statistics(...):
            pass
        
        @self.router.get("/event-rate")  # ← Move here
        async def get_event_rate():      # ← Fix indentation
            try:                          # ← Fix indentation
                # ...
```

### Affected Routes (Lines 628-921)
The following routes need to be moved into `_add_routes()`:
1. `/event-rate` (line 628) - Event rate metrics
2. `/real-time-metrics` (line 699) - Real-time dashboard metrics
3. Helper methods:
   - `_get_current_event_rate()` (line 744)
   - `_get_all_api_metrics()` (line 759)
   - `_get_api_metrics()` (line 844)
   - `_get_active_data_sources()` (line 877)
   - `_get_api_metrics_with_timeout()` (line 883)
   - `_create_fallback_metric()` (line 909)

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Code Analysis (15 min)
1. Identify exact line ranges for misplaced routes
2. Verify all route dependencies and helper methods
3. Check for any other indentation issues

### Phase 2: Fix Indentation (30 min)
1. Move route decorators inside `_add_routes()` method
2. Fix indentation for all route handlers (add 4 spaces)
3. Fix indentation for try/except blocks (add 4 spaces)
4. Ensure helper methods remain as class methods (not nested)

### Phase 3: Testing (30 min)
1. Rebuild admin-api Docker image
2. Start container and verify healthy status
3. Test each endpoint with sample requests
4. Verify integration with other services

### Phase 4: Validation (15 min)
1. Run linter on modified file
2. Check for any remaining syntax errors
3. Verify logs show no errors
4. Confirm metrics are accessible

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
```python
# tests/test_stats_endpoints.py
async def test_event_rate_endpoint():
    """Test event rate endpoint returns valid data"""
    response = await client.get("/event-rate")
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert "events_per_second" in response.json()
    assert "events_per_hour" in response.json()

async def test_real_time_metrics_endpoint():
    """Test real-time metrics endpoint"""
    response = await client.get("/real-time-metrics")
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert "event_rate" in response.json()
```

### Integration Tests
```bash
# Manual verification
docker-compose up -d admin-api
curl http://localhost:8007/stats
curl http://localhost:8007/event-rate
curl http://localhost:8007/real-time-metrics
```

### Smoke Tests
```bash
# Verify container health
docker ps | grep admin-api  # Should show "healthy"
docker logs ha-ingestor-admin --tail 50  # No errors
```

## Dependencies

### Blockers
- None (isolated fix)

### Related Stories
- None (standalone maintenance task)

### External Dependencies
- Python 3.12+ (already in use)
- FastAPI (already in use)
- Docker/Docker Compose (already configured)

## Documentation Updates

### Required
- [ ] Update service health status in deployment documentation
- [ ] Document all available statistics endpoints
- [ ] Add admin API to service dependency graph

### Optional
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guide for indentation errors
- [ ] Document best practices for adding new routes

## Risks and Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Breaking existing routes | High | Low | Careful indentation, test all endpoints |
| Helper method scope issues | Medium | Low | Keep helpers as class methods |
| Missing route registrations | Medium | Low | Verify all routes in `_add_routes()` |
| Container rebuild fails | Low | Low | Test build locally first |

## Definition of Done

- [x] Code changes committed to repository
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Unit tests passing
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] Docker container starts successfully
- [ ] All endpoints respond correctly
- [ ] No linter errors
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Deployed to development environment
- [ ] Admin verified functionality

## Notes

### Why This Happened
The error was introduced during the full rebuild and deployment process. The routes were likely added incrementally and the last batch was accidentally placed outside the method scope. This is a common Python mistake when working with class-based route registration in FastAPI.

### Prevention
1. Use linter with strict class method checking
2. Add pre-commit hook to catch indentation errors
3. Review diff carefully during route additions
4. Consider using function-based routers instead of class-based for simpler syntax

### Quick Fix Script
```python
# fix_admin_indentation.py
# Automated indentation fix (if needed)
import re

def fix_indentation(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as f:
        lines = f.readlines()
    
    # Add 4 spaces to lines 628-921
    fixed_lines = []
    in_fix_range = False
    
    for i, line in enumerate(lines, 1):
        if i == 628:
            in_fix_range = True
        elif i == 922:
            in_fix_range = False
        
        if in_fix_range and line and not line.startswith('#'):
            fixed_lines.append('    ' + line)
        else:
            fixed_lines.append(line)
    
    with open(file_path, 'w') as f:
        f.writelines(fixed_lines)
```
