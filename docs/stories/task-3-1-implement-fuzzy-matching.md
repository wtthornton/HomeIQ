- [ ] Error handling for fuzzy matching failures

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Implement Library Name Fuzzy Matching
```yaml
# Library name fuzzy matching system
library_fuzzy_matching:
  variants_mapping:
    react:
      variants: ["react", "reactjs", "react.js", "react-js", "facebook-react"]
      confidence: 1.0
    
    express:
      variants: ["express", "expressjs", "express.js", "express-js", "node-express"]
      confidence: 1.0
    
    mongodb:
      variants: ["mongodb", "mongo", "mongo-db", "mongoose", "mongodb-driver"]
      confidence: 0.9
    
    vue:
      variants: ["vue", "vuejs", "vue.js", "vue-js", "vuejs3"]
      confidence: 1.0
    
    angular:
      variants: ["angular", "angularjs", "angular.js", "angular-js", "ng"]
      confidence: 0.8
  
  matching_algorithm:
    - name: "exact_match"
      priority: 1
      confidence: 1.0
    
    - name: "variant_match"
      priority: 2
      confidence: 0.9
    
    - name: "partial_match"
      priority: 3
      confidence: 0.7
    
    - name: "fuzzy_match"
      priority: 4
      confidence: 0.5
```

### Step 2: Implement Topic Name Fuzzy Matching
```yaml
# Topic name fuzzy matching system
topic_fuzzy_matching:
  variants_mapping:
    hooks:
      variants: ["hooks", "react-hooks", "vue-hooks", "angular-hooks", "state-hooks"]
      confidence: 1.0
    
    routing:
      variants: ["routing", "router", "navigation", "routes", "url-routing"]
      confidence: 0.9
    
    authentication:
      variants: ["auth", "authentication", "login", "signin", "security"]
      confidence: 0.8
    
    testing:
      variants: ["test", "testing", "unit-test", "integration-test", "e2e-test"]
      confidence: 0.9
    
    performance:
      variants: ["perf", "performance", "optimization", "speed", "efficiency"]
      confidence: 0.8
  
  matching_algorithm:
    - name: "exact_match"
      priority: 1
      confidence: 1.0
    
    - name: "variant_match"
      priority: 2
      confidence: 0.9
    
    - name: "semantic_match"
      priority: 3
      confidence: 0.7
    
    - name: "fuzzy_match"
      priority: 4
      confidence: 0.5
```

### Step 3: Implement Confidence Scoring System
```yaml
# Confidence scoring system
confidence_scoring:
  scoring_rules:
    exact_match: 1.0
    variant_match: 0.9
    partial_match: 0.7
    semantic_match: 0.6
    fuzzy_match: 0.5
  
  threshold_settings:
    high_confidence: 0.8
    medium_confidence: 0.6
    low_confidence: 0.4
    minimum_confidence: 0.3
  
  scoring_factors:
    - name: "match_type"
      weight: 0.4
    
    - name: "string_similarity"
      weight: 0.3
    
    - name: "semantic_similarity"
      weight: 0.2
    
    - name: "usage_frequency"
      weight: 0.1
```

### Step 4: Implement Fallback Hierarchy
```yaml
# Fallback hierarchy system
fallback_hierarchy:
  lookup_sequence:
    - name: "exact_match"
      action: "check_exact_match"
      success_action: "return_cached_docs"
      failure_action: "variant_match"
    
    - name: "variant_match"
      action: "check_variant_match"
      success_action: "return_cached_docs"
      failure_action: "semantic_match"
    
    - name: "semantic_match"
      action: "check_semantic_match"
      success_action: "return_cached_docs"
      failure_action: "fuzzy_match"
    
    - name: "fuzzy_match"
      action: "check_fuzzy_match"
      success_action: "return_cached_docs"
      failure_action: "fetch_from_context7"
    
    - name: "fetch_from_context7"
      action: "call_context7_api"
      success_action: "cache_and_return"
      failure_action: "return_error"
```

## Files to Create/Modify
- `.bmad-core/kb/context7-cache/fuzzy-matching.yaml`
- `.bmad-core/tasks/context7-simple.md` (enhanced with fuzzy matching)
- `.bmad-core/data/context7-integration.md` (updated with fuzzy matching info)

## Testing
- [ ] Library name fuzzy matching works with variants
- [ ] Topic name fuzzy matching works with variants

- Confidence scoring system accurate
- Fallback hierarchy functional
- Cache hit rate improved by 15-20%
- Ready for Phase 4 implementation
