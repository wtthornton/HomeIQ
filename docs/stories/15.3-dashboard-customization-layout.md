## Story

As a dashboard user,

## Implementation Summary

### Status: Simplified Implementation

**Note:** A full drag-and-drop dashboard customization feature was initially implemented but later removed based on user feedback and complexity concerns. The feature was replaced with a tab-based navigation system that provides better performance and simpler UX.

### What Was Delivered

1. **Tab-Based Navigation System** (Alternative to drag-and-drop)
   - Multiple specialized tabs for different use cases
   - Overview, Services, Events, Logs, Sports, Analytics, Alerts, Configuration
   - Each tab optimized for its specific purpose
   - Better performance than drag-and-drop grid system

2. **Configuration Tab with Preferences**
   - Threshold configuration (Story 15.4 integration)
   - Service configuration
   - Container management
   - API key management

3. **Responsive Design**
   - Mobile-optimized tab navigation
   - Touch-friendly controls
   - Adaptive layouts per tab

### Why Simplified

- **Performance:** Tab-based navigation is faster than drag-and-drop grid
- **Simplicity:** Easier to use and maintain
- **Mobile:** Better mobile experience than complex grid layouts
- **Maintenance:** Less code to maintain, fewer dependencies
