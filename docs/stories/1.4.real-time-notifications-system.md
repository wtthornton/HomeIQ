# Story 1.4: Real-time Notifications System

## Story Overview

**As a** system administrator,  
**I want** real-time notifications for system events and alerts,  
**so that** I can stay informed about important changes and issues.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. WebSocket-based notification system is implemented
2. Users can configure notification preferences and thresholds
3. Notification history and management interface is available
4. Notifications are properly categorized by severity and type
5. Mobile-friendly notification display is implemented

## Integration Verification

**IV1**: Existing WebSocket connections continue to function  
**IV2**: Current real-time data updates are not disrupted  
**IV3**: Notification system integrates with existing error handling

## Technical Requirements

### Notification System Architecture
- Implement notification service using existing WebSocket infrastructure
- Create notification state management with React Context:
  ```tsx
  const NotificationContext = createContext<{
    notifications: Notification[];
    addNotification: (notification: Notification) => void;
    removeNotification: (id: string) => void;
  }>({
    notifications: [],
    addNotification: () => {},
    removeNotification: () => {}
  });
  ```
- Design notification data models and TypeScript interfaces:
  ```tsx
  interface Notification {
    id: string;
    type: 'info' | 'warning' | 'error' | 'success';
    title: string;
    message: string;
    timestamp: Date;
    persistent: boolean;
  }
  ```
- Ensure integration with existing real-time data flow

### Notification Types
- **System Status**: Service health changes, connection status
- **Error Alerts**: Critical errors, warnings, and failures
- **Performance**: Threshold breaches, performance degradation
- **Maintenance**: Scheduled maintenance, updates, restarts

### Notification Display
- Create notification center component
- Implement toast notifications for immediate alerts
- Add notification history and management interface
- Ensure mobile-friendly notification display

### User Preferences
- Implement notification preference management
- Add severity-based filtering options
- Create notification threshold configuration
- Ensure preferences persist across sessions

### Integration Points
- Integrate with existing WebSocket service
- Connect to existing error handling system
- Ensure compatibility with existing real-time updates
- Maintain existing system monitoring capabilities

## Dependencies

- **Prerequisites**: Story 1.1 (Foundation and Navigation)
- **Blocks**: None (can be developed in parallel)
- **External**: Existing WebSocket service, error handling system

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Notification service implemented
- [ ] WebSocket integration complete
- [ ] Notification display components working
- [ ] User preferences system implemented
- [ ] Mobile-friendly notifications working
- [ ] Integration with existing systems verified
- [ ] Real-time updates preserved
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved

## Implementation Notes

- Build on existing WebSocket infrastructure
- Implement notification queuing for offline scenarios
- Use existing error handling patterns for consistency
- Ensure notifications don't interfere with existing functionality
- Test with various notification volumes and types

## Risk Mitigation

- Test notification system with existing WebSocket connections
- Ensure notifications don't disrupt real-time data updates
- Implement notification throttling to prevent spam
- Test offline/online notification scenarios
- Maintain existing system monitoring capabilities
