### Graceful Shutdown Implementation
[Source: architecture/error-handling-strategy.md]

**Shutdown Procedures:**
- **Signal Handling:** SIGTERM and SIGINT signal handling
- **Data Persistence:** Ensure data is written before shutdown
- **Connection Cleanup:** Graceful WebSocket and database connection cleanup
- **Resource Cleanup:** Memory and file handle cleanup
- **Status Reporting:** Shutdown status and timing logging

**Context7 Implementation Patterns:**
```python
import signal
import asyncio
import logging
from contextlib import asynccontextmanager

class GracefulShutdownManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.shutdown_event = asyncio.Event()
        self.tasks = []
        
    def setup_signal_handlers(self):
        """Setup signal handlers for graceful shutdown"""
        def signal_handler(signum, frame):
            logging.info(f"Received signal {signum}, initiating graceful shutdown")
            self.shutdown_event.set()
            
        signal.signal(signal.SIGTERM, signal_handler)
        signal.signal(signal.SIGINT, signal_handler)
    
    async def wait_for_shutdown(self):
        """Wait for shutdown signal"""
        await self.shutdown_event.wait()
        
    async def cleanup_resources(self):
        """Cleanup all resources gracefully"""
        logging.info("Starting resource cleanup")
        
        # Cancel all running tasks
        for task in self.tasks:
            if not task.done():
                task.cancel()
                
        # Wait for tasks to complete
        if self.tasks:
            await asyncio.gather(*self.tasks, return_exceptions=True)
            
        logging.info("Resource cleanup completed")

# Usage in main application
async def main():
    shutdown_manager = GracefulShutdownManager()
    shutdown_manager.setup_signal_handlers()
    
    # Start services
    tasks = [
        asyncio.create_task(websocket_service()),
        asyncio.create_task(influxdb_service()),
        asyncio.create_task(admin_api_service())
    ]
    shutdown_manager.tasks.extend(tasks)
    
    # Wait for shutdown signal
    await shutdown_manager.wait_for_shutdown()
    
    # Cleanup
    await shutdown_manager.cleanup_resources()
```

**Docker Health Check Implementation:**
```python
# Health check endpoint for each service
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
import asyncio

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/health")
async def health_check():
    """Comprehensive health check endpoint"""
    health_status = {
        "status": "healthy",
        "timestamp": datetime.utcnow().isoformat(),
        "services": {}
    }
    
    # Check WebSocket connection
    try:
        ws_status = await check_websocket_health()
        health_status["services"]["websocket"] = ws_status
    except Exception as e:
        health_status["services"]["websocket"] = {"status": "unhealthy", "error": str(e)}
        health_status["status"] = "unhealthy"
    
    # Check InfluxDB connection
    try:
        db_status = await check_influxdb_health()
        health_status["services"]["influxdb"] = db_status
    except Exception as e:
        health_status["services"]["influxdb"] = {"status": "unhealthy", "error": str(e)}
        health_status["status"] = "unhealthy"
    
    if health_status["status"] == "unhealthy":
        raise HTTPException(status_code=503, detail=health_status)
    
    return health_status

async def check_websocket_health():
    """Check WebSocket connection health"""
    try:
        # Implement WebSocket ping/pong check
        return {"status": "healthy", "last_ping": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"}
    except Exception as e:
        return {"status": "unhealthy", "error": str(e)}

async def check_influxdb_health():
    """Check InfluxDB connection health"""
    try:
        # Implement InfluxDB ping check
        return {"status": "healthy", "version": "2.7.0"}
    except Exception as e:
        return {"status": "unhealthy", "error": str(e)}
```

**Docker Compose Health Check Configuration:**
```yaml
services:
  websocket-ingestion:
    image: homeiq/websocket-ingestion:latest
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:8080/health"]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 3
      start_period: 40s
    restart: unless-stopped
    
  admin-api:
    image: homeiq/admin-api:latest
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:8080/health"]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 3
      start_period: 40s
    restart: unless-stopped
```

### Coding Standards
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

**Critical Rules:**
- **Configuration Management:** All configuration must be environment-based
- **Resource Management:** All services must have resource limits
- **Error Handling:** All deployment operations must handle failures gracefully
- **Naming Conventions:** 
  - Services: kebab-case (e.g., `websocket-ingestion`)
  - Volumes: snake_case (e.g., `influxdb_data`)
  - Networks: kebab-case (e.g., `homeiq-network`)

### Performance Considerations

**Deployment Performance:**
- Resource limits prevent service resource exhaustion
- Service discovery optimizes container communication
- Graceful shutdown ensures data integrity
- Health checks enable automatic service recovery
- Configuration optimization for production workloads

### System Requirements
[Source: architecture/development-workflow.md]

**Minimum System Requirements:**
- **CPU:** 2 cores (4 cores recommended)

- **Network:** Stable internet connection for weather API
- **Docker:** Docker 20.10+ and Docker Compose 2.0+

**Recommended Hardware:**
- **CPU:** 4+ cores for high-volume processing
- **Memory:** 8GB+ RAM for optimal performance
- **Storage:** SSD storage for database performance
- **Network:** Gigabit ethernet for Home Assistant connectivity

### Deployment Automation
