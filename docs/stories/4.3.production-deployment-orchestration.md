### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

**Deployment Test Organization:**
```
tests/
├── deployment/
│   ├── test_docker_compose.py
│   ├── test_deployment_config.py
│   ├── test_resource_limits.py
│   ├── test_graceful_shutdown.py
│   └── test_service_discovery.py
└── integration/
    ├── test_full_deployment.py
    └── test_production_scenarios.py
```

**Test Examples:**
```python
import pytest
import docker
import time
from docker_compose import DockerCompose

@pytest.mark.integration
def test_docker_compose_deployment():
    compose = DockerCompose("docker-compose.yml")
    
    # Test service startup
    compose.up(detach=True)
    
    # Wait for services to be healthy
    time.sleep(30)
    
    # Verify all services are running
    services = compose.ps()
    assert len(services) == 4  # All services running
    
    # Test service communication
    admin_api = compose.service("admin-api")
    health_response = admin_api.get("/health")
    assert health_response.status_code == 200
    
    # Cleanup
    compose.down()

@pytest.mark.integration
def test_graceful_shutdown():
    compose = DockerCompose("docker-compose.yml")
    compose.up(detach=True)
    
    # Test graceful shutdown
    compose.down(timeout=30)
    
    # Verify no running containers
    containers = compose.ps()
    assert len(containers) == 0
```

### Coding Standards
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

**Critical Rules:**
- **Configuration Management:** All configuration must be environment-based
- **Resource Management:** All services must have resource limits
- **Error Handling:** All deployment operations must handle failures gracefully
- **Naming Conventions:** 
  - Services: kebab-case (e.g., `websocket-ingestion`)
  - Volumes: snake_case (e.g., `influxdb_data`)
  - Networks: kebab-case (e.g., `ha-ingestor-network`)

### Performance Considerations
[Source: architecture/security-and-performance.md]

**Deployment Performance:**
- Resource limits prevent service resource exhaustion
- Service discovery optimizes container communication
- Graceful shutdown ensures data integrity
- Health checks enable automatic service recovery
- Configuration optimization for production workloads

### System Requirements
[Source: architecture/development-workflow.md]

**Minimum System Requirements:**
- **CPU:** 2 cores (4 cores recommended)
- **Memory:** 4GB RAM (8GB recommended)
- **Storage:** 20GB available space (50GB recommended)
- **Network:** Stable internet connection for weather API
- **Docker:** Docker 20.10+ and Docker Compose 2.0+

**Recommended Hardware:**
- **CPU:** 4+ cores for high-volume processing
- **Memory:** 8GB+ RAM for optimal performance
- **Storage:** SSD storage for database performance
- **Network:** Gigabit ethernet for Home Assistant connectivity

### Deployment Automation
[Source: architecture/development-workflow.md]

**Deployment Scripts:**
- **Setup Script:** Automated initial setup and configuration
- **Deployment Script:** Automated deployment and validation
- **Backup Script:** Automated backup and restore procedures
- **Maintenance Script:** Automated maintenance and optimization
- **Monitoring Script:** Deployment health monitoring and alerting
