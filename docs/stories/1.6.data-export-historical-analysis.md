# Story 1.6: Data Export and Historical Analysis

## Story Overview

**As a** system administrator,  
**I want** to export data and perform historical analysis,  
**so that** I can create reports and analyze trends over time.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Data export functionality supports multiple formats (CSV, JSON, PDF)
2. Historical data analysis with configurable time ranges is available
3. Export includes customizable data selection and filtering
4. Large dataset exports are handled efficiently
5. Export history and management is available

## Integration Verification

**IV1**: Existing data APIs support the new export functionality  
**IV2**: Current data structures and formats are preserved  
**IV3**: Export functionality doesn't impact real-time performance

## Technical Requirements

### Export System
- Implement data export service with TypeScript interfaces:
  ```tsx
  interface ExportOptions {
    format: 'csv' | 'json' | 'pdf' | 'excel';
    dateRange: { start: Date; end: Date };
    filters: Record<string, any>;
    includeMetadata: boolean;
  }
  
  interface ExportResult {
    success: boolean;
    downloadUrl?: string;
    error?: string;
    progress?: number;
  }
  ```
- Create export UI components with progress tracking:
  ```tsx
  const ExportDialog = ({ isOpen, onClose, onExport }: ExportDialogProps) => {
    const [progress, setProgress] = useState(0);
    const [isExporting, setIsExporting] = useState(false);
    
    const handleExport = async (options: ExportOptions) => {
      setIsExporting(true);
      const result = await exportService.exportData(options, setProgress);
      setIsExporting(false);
      onExport(result);
    };
  };
  ```
- Add export progress tracking and status management
- Ensure export functionality works with existing data sources

### Export Formats
- **CSV**: Tabular data export for spreadsheet analysis
- **JSON**: Structured data export for programmatic use
- **PDF**: Formatted report export for documentation
- **Excel**: Advanced spreadsheet export with formatting

### Historical Analysis
- Implement time range selection for historical data
- Add data aggregation and summarization features
- Create trend analysis and comparison tools
- Ensure historical data doesn't impact real-time performance

### Data Selection
- Implement customizable data selection interface
- Add filtering options for export data
- Create data preview before export
- Ensure data selection works with all data sources

### Performance Optimization
- Implement data pagination for large exports
- Add background export processing
- Create export queue management
- Ensure exports don't impact dashboard performance

## Dependencies

- **Prerequisites**: Story 1.3 (Advanced Data Visualization)
- **Blocks**: None (can be developed in parallel)
- **External**: Existing data APIs, export libraries, PDF generation

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Export system implemented
- [ ] Multiple export formats working
- [ ] Historical analysis features complete
- [ ] Data selection interface working
- [ ] Performance optimization implemented
- [ ] Export history management working
- [ ] Integration with existing APIs verified
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved

## Implementation Notes

- Build on existing data APIs and structures
- Implement export processing in background to avoid UI blocking
- Use existing filtering and data selection patterns
- Ensure export functionality is accessible and user-friendly
- Test with various data sizes and export formats

## Risk Mitigation

- Test export functionality with existing data sources
- Ensure exports don't impact real-time dashboard performance
- Implement proper error handling for export failures
- Test with large datasets to ensure performance
- Maintain data integrity during export operations
