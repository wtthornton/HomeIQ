**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE**  
**Created:** 2025-10-13  
**Completed:** 2025-10-13  
**Epic Owner:** Architecture Team  
**Development Lead:** BMad Master Agent

## Epic Goal

Refactor the overloaded admin-api service into two specialized services: admin-api (system monitoring & control) and data-api (feature data hub), improving performance, reliability, and scalability while enabling future enhancements like sports data InfluxDB persistence and Home Assistant automation integration.

---

## Epic Description

### Existing System Context

**Current Functionality:**
- **Service**: admin-api (FastAPI) running on port 8003
- **Endpoints**: 60+ endpoints across 14 modules
- **Responsibilities**: 
  - System health monitoring (health checks, dependencies, service status)
  - Docker container management (start, stop, restart, logs)
  - System configuration management
  - HA event queries from InfluxDB
  - Device and entity browsing
  - Integration management
  - Alert management
  - Real-time WebSocket streaming
  - Metrics and analytics

**Technology Stack:**
- **Backend**: Python 3.11, FastAPI 0.104.1
- **Database**: InfluxDB 2.7 (queries for both system stats and feature data)
- **Deployment**: Docker Compose, nginx reverse proxy
- **Dashboard Integration**: All 12 tabs call admin-api on port 8003

**Integration Points:**
- Dashboard → nginx (port 3000) → admin-api (port 8003)
- Admin-api → InfluxDB (port 8086) for queries
- Admin-api → Docker socket for container management
- Admin-api → Other services for health checks

**Current Pain Points:**
1. **Overloaded Service**: 60+ endpoints with mixed concerns (system vs features)
2. **Performance Contention**: Heavy InfluxDB queries slow down health checks
3. **Single Point of Failure**: Both monitoring AND features unavailable if service fails
4. **Cannot Scale Independently**: Feature queries need more resources than health checks
5. **Maintenance Complexity**: 14 endpoint modules in single codebase

---

### Enhancement Details

**What's Being Changed:**

1. **Split admin-api into Two Services**
   - **admin-api** (port 8003, existing): System monitoring, Docker management, configuration
   - **data-api** (port 8006, NEW): Feature data, InfluxDB queries, HA automation integration

2. **Migrate ~40 Feature Endpoints to data-api**
   - Events endpoints (8) - HA event queries
   - Devices endpoints (5) - Device/entity browsing
   - Integration endpoints (7) - Integration management
   - Alert endpoints (5) - Alert system
   - Metrics endpoints (6) - Analytics queries
   - WebSocket endpoints (3) - Real-time streaming
   - Sports endpoints (NEW from Epic 12)
   - HA automation endpoints (NEW from Epic 12)

3. **Move Shared Code to shared/ Directory**
   - `auth.py` → `shared/auth.py` (reused by both)
   - `influxdb_client.py` → `shared/influxdb_query_client.py` (reused by both)
   - Authentication and authorization shared utilities

4. **Update Dashboard API Service Layer**
   - Create separate clients: `AdminApiClient` and `DataApiClient`
   - Update all dashboard components to use correct client
   - Abstract behind service layer (minimal component changes)

5. **Update Nginx Routing**
   - Path-based routing to admin-api vs data-api
   - Backward compatibility during migration
   - Clear URL structure for future maintainability

**How It Integrates:**

- **Infrastructure**: New data-api container added to docker-compose.yml
- **Database**: Both services query InfluxDB (admin-api: system metrics only, data-api: full access)
- **Authentication**: Shared auth module in `shared/auth.py`
- **Dashboard**: API service layer updated, component code mostly unchanged
- **Nginx**: Routing rules updated for path-based service selection
- **Service Discovery**: Both services registered in Docker Compose network

**Success Criteria:**

1. ✅ admin-api contains only system monitoring endpoints (~22)
2. ✅ data-api contains all feature endpoints (~45+)
3. ✅ Dashboard works with split architecture (all 12 tabs functional)
4. ✅ Health check response time improves by 50%+ (<50ms)
5. ✅ No regression in existing functionality
6. ✅ data-api can be scaled to 2-4 instances
7. ✅ Backward compatibility maintained during migration
8. ✅ Documentation updated (architecture, API docs)

## Stories

### Story 13.1: Create data-api Service Foundation

**Goal**: Create new data-api service with FastAPI foundation, Docker configuration, and basic health endpoint

**Key Tasks:**
- Create `services/data-api/` directory structure
- Setup FastAPI application with CORS middleware
- Create Dockerfile and Dockerfile.dev (follow admin-api pattern)
- Add to docker-compose.yml on port 8006
- Move shared code: `auth.py`, `influxdb_client.py` to `shared/`
- Update both services to import from `shared/`
- Create basic health endpoint: `GET /health`
- Setup logging with correlation middleware
- Unit tests for service initialization
- CI/CD pipeline integration (GitHub Actions)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] data-api service builds successfully (Docker image)
- [ ] Service starts on port 8006
- [ ] Health endpoint responds: `GET http://localhost:8006/health`
- [ ] Shared code accessible from both admin-api and data-api
- [ ] No breaking changes to admin-api (still functional)
- [ ] Docker Compose starts all services including data-api
- [ ] Unit tests pass with >80% coverage

## Compatibility Requirements

- [x] **Existing admin-api Unchanged Initially**: Service continues running during migration
- [x] **Backward Compatibility**: Feature flags allow gradual cutover
- [x] **Dashboard Updates**: Service layer abstracts API changes from components
- [x] **Nginx Routing**: Path-based routing maintains URL structure
- [x] **No Data Migration**: InfluxDB data unchanged (only client changes)
- [x] **Docker Compose**: Both services run simultaneously during migration
- [x] **Environment Variables**: New vars with sensible defaults (backward compatible)
- [x] **Rollback Capability**: Can disable data-api and revert to admin-api

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Primary Risk: Dashboard Breakage During Migration

**Symptoms**: Tabs not loading, API errors, missing data

**Mitigation:**
- Phased rollout (one tab at a time)
- Feature flag in dashboard: `USE_DATA_API=false` (rollback switch)
- Dual routing in nginx (try data-api, fallback to admin-api)
- Comprehensive regression testing before each phase
- Monitoring dashboard error rates during migration

**Rollback**: Set `USE_DATA_API=false` → Dashboard reverts to admin-api → <5 minutes

---

### Secondary Risk: Nginx Configuration Errors

**Symptoms**: 502 Bad Gateway, routing to wrong service

**Mitigation:**
- Test nginx config before deployment: `nginx -t`
- Staged rollout (dev → staging → production)
- Keep old nginx.conf as backup
- Clear documentation of routing rules
- Health checks verify routing correctness

**Rollback**: Restore old nginx.conf → reload nginx → <2 minutes

---

### Tertiary Risk: InfluxDB Connection Pooling Issues

**Symptoms**: Connection exhaustion, slow queries, timeouts

**Mitigation:**
- Configure connection pools properly (max 10 connections per service)
- Monitor InfluxDB connection count
- Implement connection timeout (5 seconds)
- Circuit breaker pattern for InfluxDB failures
- Graceful degradation (return cached data if DB unavailable)

**Rollback**: Reduce data-api instances → <5 minutes

### Nginx Routing Strategy

```nginx
# System monitoring (admin-api)
location /api/v1/health {
    proxy_pass http://admin-api:8003;
}
location /api/v1/monitoring {
    proxy_pass http://admin-api:8003;
}
location /api/docker/ {
    proxy_pass http://admin-api:8003;
}

# Feature data (data-api)
location /api/v1/events {
    proxy_pass http://data-api:8006;
}
location /api/v1/devices {
    proxy_pass http://data-api:8006;
}
location /api/v1/sports {
    proxy_pass http://data-api:8006;
}
location /api/v1/ha {
    proxy_pass http://data-api:8006;
}
location /api/v1/analytics {
    proxy_pass http://data-api:8006;
}
```

## Integration with Epic 12 (Sports InfluxDB)

**Epic 12 Dependencies on Epic 13**:

Epic 12 stories assume sports data and HA automation endpoints go into a service. With Epic 13, that service is **data-api**, not admin-api.

**Modified Epic 12 Implementation**:
- Story 12.1: Sports InfluxDB writer → sports-data service (unchanged)
- Story 12.2: Historical query endpoints → **data-api** (not admin-api)
- Story 12.3: HA automation endpoints → **data-api** (not admin-api)

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Natural separation: Sports features in feature service (data-api)
- ✅ admin-api stays clean (no sports endpoints)
- ✅ data-api becomes comprehensive feature hub
- ✅ HA automation endpoints logically grouped with other HA features

**Implementation Order**:
1. Complete Epic 13 Stories 1-3 (data-api exists and functional)
2. Implement Epic 12 (sports endpoints go into data-api)
3. Complete Epic 13 Story 4 (finalize integration)

## Story Manager Handoff

**For Story Manager:**

Please develop detailed user stories for this brownfield refactoring epic. Key considerations:

**Existing System Context:**
- Refactoring of existing admin-api service (Python 3.11 + FastAPI)
- Current architecture: Monolithic gateway (60+ endpoints)
- Running services: admin-api (8003), dashboard (3000), InfluxDB (8086)

**Integration Points:**
- New data-api service (port 8006)
- Shared utilities: `shared/auth.py`, `shared/influxdb_query_client.py`
- Dashboard API service layer: `services/health-dashboard/src/services/api.ts`
- Nginx reverse proxy: `services/health-dashboard/nginx.conf`
- Docker Compose: `docker-compose.yml`

**Existing Patterns to Follow:**
- FastAPI application structure (same as admin-api)
- InfluxDB query patterns (use AdminAPIInfluxDBClient as template)
- Docker container configuration (Alpine-based, multi-stage builds)
- Environment variable configuration (.env files)
- Health check endpoint structure

**Critical Compatibility Requirements:**
- ALL existing admin-api endpoints MUST continue working during migration
- Dashboard MUST work throughout migration (feature flags for gradual cutover)
- Nginx routing MUST support both services simultaneously
- InfluxDB queries MUST not degrade performance
- Each story must include comprehensive regression testing
- Rollback MUST be possible at any point (feature flags + nginx config)

**Development Sequence:**
1. Story 13.1: Foundation (data-api exists, can receive traffic)
2. Story 13.2: First migration (events + devices, prove the pattern)
3. Story 13.3: Complete migration (all feature endpoints moved)
4. Story 13.4: Enhancement (Epic 12 integration, new features)

**Epic 12 Integration**:
This epic creates the **data-api** service that will host Epic 12 (sports InfluxDB) endpoints. Epic 12 Stories 12.2 and 12.3 should implement endpoints in data-api (not admin-api).

The epic should maintain system integrity while properly separating system monitoring from feature data access.
