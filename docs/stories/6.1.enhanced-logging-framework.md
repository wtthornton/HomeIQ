# Story 6.1: Enhanced Logging Framework

## Status
Draft

## Story

**As a** system administrator and operations team,  
**I want** all services to implement structured logging with consistent format and correlation IDs,  
**so that** I can effectively trace requests across services and troubleshoot issues with full context and visibility.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **AC1: Structured Logging Format** - All services log in consistent JSON format with required fields (timestamp, level, service, message, correlation_id, context)
2. **AC2: Correlation ID Implementation** - All services implement correlation IDs for request tracing across service boundaries
3. **AC3: Log Level Standardization** - All services use standardized log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL) consistently
4. **AC4: Context Information** - All services include relevant context information (user_id, request_id, operation_type, duration) in logs
5. **AC5: Performance Logging** - All services log performance metrics (response times, resource usage, throughput) for monitoring
6. **AC6: Error Logging Enhancement** - All services provide detailed error logging with stack traces, error codes, and recovery actions
7. **AC7: Log Configuration** - All services support configurable log levels and output formats through environment variables
8. **AC8: Log Validation** - All log entries are validated for required fields and format consistency

## Dev Notes

### Current Logging State

**Existing Foundation:**
- ✅ Basic logging framework in `shared/logging_config.py`
- ✅ Service-specific logging implementations
- ✅ Basic error logging across services
- ✅ Health check logging

**Current Logging Format:**
```python
# Current basic logging format
logger.info(f"Processing event: {event_id}")
logger.error(f"Error processing event {event_id}: {error}")
```

**Required Enhanced Format:**
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-01-04T15:30:45.123Z",
  "level": "INFO",
  "service": "websocket-ingestion",
  "message": "Processing Home Assistant event",
  "correlation_id": "req_12345_abc",
  "context": {
    "event_id": "ha_event_67890",
    "entity_id": "sensor.temperature",
    "domain": "sensor",
    "user_id": "admin",
    "operation_type": "event_processing",
    "duration_ms": 45.2
  },
  "performance": {
    "response_time_ms": 45.2,
    "memory_usage_mb": 128.5,
    "cpu_usage_percent": 12.3
  }
}
```

### Implementation Strategy

**Phase 1: Core Framework Enhancement**
1. Enhance `shared/logging_config.py` with structured logging
2. Add correlation ID support and middleware
3. Implement configurable log levels and formats

**Phase 2: Service-by-Service Implementation**
1. Update each service to use enhanced logging framework
2. Add service-specific context information
3. Implement performance and error logging

**Phase 3: Integration and Validation**
1. Test correlation ID propagation across services
2. Validate log format consistency
3. Performance testing for logging overhead

### Source Tree Information

**Key Files to Modify:**
- `shared/logging_config.py` - Core logging framework
- `services/*/src/main.py` - Service entry points
- `services/*/src/*.py` - Service-specific logging
- `docker-compose.yml` - Log aggregation configuration

**New Files to Create:**
- `shared/correlation_middleware.py` - Correlation ID middleware
- `shared/log_validator.py` - Log format validation
- `tests/logging_tests.py` - Logging integration tests

### Testing Requirements

**Unit Tests:**
- Log format validation tests
- Correlation ID generation and propagation tests
- Log level configuration tests
- Performance logging tests

**Integration Tests:**
- Service-to-service correlation ID propagation
- Log aggregation and collection tests
- Performance impact tests
- Error logging integration tests

**Performance Tests:**
- Logging overhead measurement
- High-volume logging performance
- Memory usage impact
- CPU usage impact

### Configuration Requirements

**Environment Variables:**
```bash
# Logging Configuration
LOG_LEVEL=INFO                    # DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL
LOG_FORMAT=json                   # json, text
LOG_OUTPUT=stdout                 # stdout, file, both
LOG_FILE_PATH=/var/log/homeiq/
LOG_MAX_SIZE=100MB               # Log file rotation size
LOG_BACKUP_COUNT=5               # Number of backup files
ENABLE_PERFORMANCE_LOGGING=true   # Enable performance metrics logging
ENABLE_CORRELATION_IDS=true       # Enable correlation ID tracking
```

**Docker Configuration:**
- Update docker-compose.yml for log aggregation
- Configure log drivers for centralized collection
- Set up log volume mounts for persistence

### Performance Considerations

**Logging Overhead:**
- Use asynchronous logging to minimize performance impact
- Implement log buffering for high-volume scenarios
- Optimize JSON serialization for structured logs
- Use efficient correlation ID generation

**Storage Management:**
- Implement log rotation and retention policies
- Use compression for log storage
- Monitor disk usage and implement alerts
- Consider log archiving for long-term storage

### Security Considerations

**Sensitive Data:**
- Implement data sanitization for logs
- Avoid logging sensitive information (passwords, tokens)
- Use data masking for PII in logs
- Implement log access controls

**Log Integrity:**
- Ensure log tampering detection
- Implement log signing for critical operations
- Use secure log transmission
- Monitor for log injection attacks
