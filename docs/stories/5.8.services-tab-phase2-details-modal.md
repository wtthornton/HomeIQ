# Story 5.8: Services Tab - Phase 2: Service Details Modal

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story

**As a** system administrator,  
**I want** to view detailed information about a specific service in a modal dialog,  
**so that** I can diagnose issues and monitor service health without leaving the Services tab.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Clicking "View Details" on any service card opens a modal dialog
2. Modal displays comprehensive service information:
   - Service overview (name, status, uptime, container ID)
   - Real-time metrics chart (last hour - requests, errors)
   - Recent logs (last 50 lines with timestamps)
   - Health check history (last 24 hours)
   - Resource usage (CPU, Memory)
3. Modal is responsive and works on mobile devices
4. Modal has close button (X) and backdrop click to close
5. Modal supports dark/light mode
6. Charts update in real-time while modal is open
7. Logs auto-scroll to latest entries
8. Resource metrics show as progress bars with percentages

## Dev Notes

**Context7 KB Used:**
- React Chart.js patterns (`docs/kb/context7-cache/react-dashboard-ui-patterns.md`)
- Chart.js Line chart for metrics history
- Tailwind CSS for modal styling

**Technical Approach:**
- Create `ServiceDetailsModal.tsx` component with Portal
- Use Chart.js for metrics visualization
- Create API endpoint for service logs: `GET /api/v1/services/{service}/logs`
- Create API endpoint for service details: `GET /api/v1/services/{service}/details`
- Add health check history visualization
- Use Tailwind fixed overlay for modal backdrop
- Implement escape key handler for accessibility

**New API Endpoints Needed:**
- `GET /api/v1/services/{service}/details` - Detailed service info
- `GET /api/v1/services/{service}/logs?limit=50` - Recent logs
- `GET /api/v1/services/{service}/metrics?period=1h` - Time-series metrics
- `GET /api/v1/services/{service}/health-history?period=24h` - Health checks
