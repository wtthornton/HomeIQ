# Epic 15: Advanced Dashboard Features - Brownfield Enhancement

## Epic Goal

Add power-user features including real-time WebSocket updates, customizable dashboard layouts, and enhanced personalization capabilities.

## Epic Description

### Existing System Context

- **Current functionality:** Dashboard uses HTTP polling (30s intervals) for updates, fixed layout
- **Technology stack:** React 18.2 + TypeScript, Admin API (FastAPI), existing WebSocket infrastructure
- **Integration points:** Admin API, WebSocket ingestion service, user preferences system

### Enhancement Details

**What's being added:**
- WebSocket support for instant updates (no polling lag)
- Push notifications for critical alerts
- Live event stream viewer
- Real-time log tail viewer
- Customizable dashboard layout (drag-and-drop widgets)
- User preference persistence
- Custom metric thresholds
- Widget library for dashboard customization

**How it integrates:**
- Leverages existing WebSocket infrastructure
- Extends Admin API with WebSocket endpoints
- Uses localStorage for user preferences
- Follows existing component patterns
- Optional features (progressive enhancement)

**Success criteria:**
- <500ms update latency (vs 30s polling)
- Zero-downtime transition from polling to WebSocket
- Dashboard customization persists across sessions
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- Performance remains excellent with WebSocket

## Stories

### Story 15.1: Real-Time WebSocket Integration
Replace HTTP polling with WebSocket connections for instant system updates and push notifications.

**Key Tasks:**
- Add WebSocket client to dashboard
- Create useWebSocket hook
- Implement reconnection logic with exponential backoff
- Add WebSocket endpoint to Admin API (`/ws/metrics`)
- Stream real-time metrics over WebSocket
- Push notification system for critical alerts
- Fallback to polling if WebSocket unavailable
- WebSocket connection status indicator
- Connection health monitoring
- Message queue for offline resilience
- Rate limiting and throttling
- Error handling and recovery

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] WebSocket connection established successfully
- [ ] <500ms update latency
- [ ] Automatic reconnection on disconnect
- [ ] Fallback to polling works seamlessly
- [ ] Push notifications functional
- [ ] Connection status visible to user
- [ ] No memory leaks
- [ ] Performance better than polling

**Estimated Effort:** 3-4 days

### Story 15.2: Live Event Stream & Log Viewer
Add real-time event stream and log tail viewer for debugging and monitoring.

**Key Tasks:**
- Create EventStreamViewer component
- Create LogTailViewer component
- WebSocket stream for live events
- WebSocket stream for logs
- Event filtering by:
  - Service
  - Severity
  - Time range
  - Event type
- Log filtering and search
- Auto-scroll toggle
- Pause/resume stream
- Copy event/log to clipboard
- Event detail expansion
- Performance optimization (virtual scrolling)
- Buffer management (max 1000 events)
- Color-coded log levels
- Timestamp formatting

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Live events stream in real-time
- [ ] Logs update instantly
- [ ] Filtering works correctly
- [ ] Performance good with high event rate
- [ ] Auto-scroll toggles properly
- [ ] Virtual scrolling implemented
- [ ] Memory usage stays <50MB
- [ ] Dark mode support

**Estimated Effort:** 3-4 days

### Story 15.3: Dashboard Customization & Layout
Implement drag-and-drop dashboard customization with persistent layouts and widget library.

**Key Tasks:**
- Create DashboardGrid component
- Implement drag-and-drop with react-grid-layout
- Widget library:
  - System health widget
  - Metrics chart widget
  - Service status widget
  - Alert widget
  - Event stream widget
  - Custom metric widget
- Layout persistence (localStorage)
- Multiple layout presets:
  - Default
  - Operations
  - Development
  - Executive
- Widget configuration modal
- Add/remove widgets
- Resize widgets
- Reset to default layout
- Export/import layout configuration

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Drag-and-drop works smoothly
- [ ] Layout persists across sessions
- [ ] All widgets functional
- [ ] Presets switch correctly
- [ ] Widget configuration works
- [ ] Mobile-responsive grid
- [ ] Performance optimized
- [ ] Dark mode support

**Estimated Effort:** 4-5 days

### Story 15.4: Custom Thresholds & Personalization
Add user-configurable metric thresholds, alerts, and dashboard personalization.

**Key Tasks:**
- Create ThresholdConfig component
- Custom threshold editor:
  - Events per minute threshold
  - Error rate threshold
  - Response time threshold
  - API usage threshold
- Visual indicators when thresholds exceeded
- Per-user alert preferences
- Color scheme customization
- Timezone preference
- Refresh interval preference
- Notification preferences:
  - Browser notifications
  - Sound alerts
  - Email notifications (backend)
- Preference sync across devices
- Export preferences
- Reset to defaults

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Thresholds configurable per metric
- [ ] Visual indicators appear correctly
- [ ] Preferences persist across sessions
- [ ] Notification preferences work
- [ ] Timezone handling correct
- [ ] Performance unaffected
- [ ] Dark mode compatible
- [ ] Mobile-friendly config UI

**Estimated Effort:** 3-4 days

## Compatibility Requirements

- [x] Existing polling mode preserved (fallback)
- [x] Database schema changes are backward compatible (localStorage for preferences)
- [x] UI changes follow existing patterns (React, Tailwind)
- [x] Performance impact is positive (faster updates, less polling)

## Risk Mitigation

**Primary Risk:** WebSocket connection instability affecting dashboard reliability

**Mitigation:**
- Automatic fallback to HTTP polling
- Robust reconnection logic with backoff
- Connection health monitoring
- User-visible connection status
- Graceful degradation strategy
- Extensive error handling
- Performance monitoring

**Rollback Plan:**
- Feature flags for WebSocket features
- Disable customization via flag
- Revert to standard polling mode
- No data loss (preferences in localStorage)
- Zero impact on core functionality

## Definition of Done

- [x] All 4 stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- [x] WebSocket updates working reliably
- [x] Event stream and logs functional
- [x] Dashboard customization persists
- [x] Custom thresholds working
- [x] Performance excellent (no regressions)
- [x] Fallback mechanisms tested
- [x] Mobile responsive
- [x] E2E tests for all features
- [x] Documentation updated (user guide, API docs)

## Dependencies

- Epic 12, 13, 14 (complete dashboard foundation)
- Existing WebSocket infrastructure
- New npm dependency: react-grid-layout (for drag-and-drop)

## Estimated Effort

- Story 15.2: 3-4 days (Event stream & logs)
- Story 15.3: 4-5 days (Dashboard customization)
- Story 15.4: 3-4 days (Custom thresholds)

**Total:** ~13-17 days (2.5-3.5 weeks)
