# Story 30.1: Performance Analysis Engine

## Story Overview
**Story ID**: STORY-30.1  
**Epic**: EPIC-30 (Performance Optimization Engine)  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Story Points**: 8  
**Sprint**: Sprint 3  

## User Story
**As a** HA Ingestor user  
**I want** automated analysis of my Home Assistant performance  
**So that** I can identify bottlenecks and optimization opportunities  

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Analyze HA response times and identify slow operations
- [ ] Monitor resource usage (CPU, memory, disk)
- [ ] Check integration performance and efficiency
- [ ] Identify configuration inefficiencies
- [ ] Detect resource-intensive automations
- [ ] Provide performance baseline comparison
- [ ] Generate performance reports

## Technical Requirements
- Create performance analysis service
- Implement response time monitoring
- Add resource usage tracking
- Create integration performance analysis
- Implement configuration analysis
- Add automation performance monitoring
- Design performance reporting system

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Performance analysis service implemented
- [ ] Response time monitoring working
- [ ] Resource usage tracked
- [ ] Integration analysis complete
- [ ] Configuration analysis functional
- [ ] Automation monitoring active
- [ ] Performance reports generated
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing
- [ ] Integration tests completed

## Dependencies
- Environment health monitoring
- HA API integration
- Metrics collection system

## Risks
- **Risk**: Performance monitoring overhead
  - **Mitigation**: Lightweight monitoring with configurable intervals
- **Risk**: False positive performance issues
  - **Mitigation**: Baseline comparison and user feedback
