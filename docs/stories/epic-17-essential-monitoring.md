## üîß Technical Approach

### Architecture
- **Logging**: Centralized log collection using Docker logging drivers
- **Monitoring**: Enhanced health endpoints with dependency checks
- **Metrics**: In-memory metrics collection with periodic persistence
- **Alerting**: Simple threshold-based alerting with dashboard integration

### Technology Choices
- **Logging**: Docker logging + structured JSON logs
- **Metrics**: Custom metrics collection (avoiding heavy dependencies)
- **Storage**: InfluxDB for metrics persistence
- **Display**: Enhanced health dashboard components

### Integration Points
- All services enhanced with monitoring capabilities
- Health dashboard updated with monitoring views
- InfluxDB schema extended for metrics storage
- Docker Compose updated with logging configuration

---

## üìà Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- **Log Coverage**: 100% of services sending structured logs
- **Health Check Coverage**: All services have comprehensive health endpoints
- **Alert Response Time**: Critical alerts triggered within 30 seconds
- **Dashboard Load Time**: Monitoring dashboard loads in <2 seconds

### Business Metrics
- **Issue Detection Time**: Critical issues detected within 5 minutes
- **Troubleshooting Efficiency**: 50% reduction in issue resolution time
- **System Uptime**: 99.5% uptime with proper monitoring
- **User Satisfaction**: Clear visibility into system status

---

## üö´ Non-Goals (Avoiding Over-Engineering)

### What We're NOT Doing
- Complex alerting rules with multiple escalation paths
- Advanced analytics and machine learning for anomaly detection
- Integration with external monitoring platforms (Grafana, Prometheus, etc.)
- Historical trend analysis beyond basic performance tracking
- Custom dashboards beyond the existing health dashboard
- Advanced log analysis and search capabilities
- Distributed tracing across services
- Advanced performance profiling and optimization

### Why These Are Out of Scope
- **Simplicity**: Focus on essential monitoring needs only
- **Maintenance**: Avoid complex systems that require ongoing maintenance
- **Cost**: No additional infrastructure or licensing costs
- **Time**: Deliver value quickly without over-engineering
- **Personal Project**: Appropriate scope for home automation system
