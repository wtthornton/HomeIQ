### Retention Policy Management

**Retention Policy Implementation:**
```sql
-- Raw Data Retention Policy
CREATE RETENTION POLICY "raw_data_policy" ON "home_assistant"
DURATION 365d REPLICATION 1 SHARD DURATION 7d;

-- Hourly Summary Retention Policy
CREATE RETENTION POLICY "hourly_summary_policy" ON "home_assistant"
DURATION 730d REPLICATION 1 SHARD DURATION 30d;

-- Daily Summary Retention Policy
CREATE RETENTION POLICY "daily_summary_policy" ON "home_assistant"

```

### Storage Monitoring Data Models

```typescript
interface StorageMetrics {
  database_size_bytes: number;
  database_size_gb: number;
  storage_usage_percent: number;
  retention_compliance_percent: number;
  compression_ratio: number;
  backup_size_bytes: number;
  last_backup_timestamp: string;
  storage_growth_rate_gb_per_day: number;
  estimated_capacity_days: number;
}
```

### Backup and Restore Strategy
[Source: architecture/development-workflow.md]

**Backup Implementation:**
- **Database Backup:** InfluxDB backup tools for data export
- **Volume Backup:** Docker volume backup for persistent data
- **Configuration Backup:** Application configuration and settings
- **Backup Verification:** Integrity checking and validation
- **Restore Testing:** Regular restore testing and validation

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

**Storage Management Test Organization:**
```
services/admin-api/tests/
├── test_retention_policies.py
├── test_storage_monitoring.py
├── test_data_compression.py
├── test_backup_restore.py
└── test_storage_optimization.py
```

**Test Examples:**
```python
import pytest
import asyncio
from services.admin_api.src.retention_service import RetentionService
from services.admin_api.src.storage_service import StorageService

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_retention_policy_enforcement():
    retention_service = RetentionService()
    
    # Test retention policy creation and enforcement
    await retention_service.create_retention_policy(
        name="test_policy",
        duration_days=30,
        shard_duration_days=7
    )
    
    # Verify policy is active
    policies = await retention_service.get_active_policies()
    assert any(policy.name == "test_policy" for policy in policies)
    
    # Test data cleanup
    cleanup_result = await retention_service.cleanup_expired_data()
    assert cleanup_result.records_deleted >= 0

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_storage_monitoring():
    storage_service = StorageService()
    
    # Test storage metrics collection
    metrics = await storage_service.get_storage_metrics()
    
    assert metrics.database_size_bytes > 0
    assert metrics.storage_usage_percent >= 0
    assert metrics.storage_usage_percent <= 100
    assert metrics.retention_compliance_percent >= 0
    assert metrics.retention_compliance_percent <= 100
```

### Coding Standards
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

**Critical Rules:**
- **Data Safety:** All retention operations must be validated before execution
- **Backup Integrity:** All backups must be verified for integrity
- **Error Handling:** All storage operations must handle failures gracefully
- **Naming Conventions:** 
  - Functions: snake_case (e.g., `cleanup_expired_data()`)
  - Storage Metrics: snake_case (e.g., `database_size_bytes`)
  - Configuration: UPPER_CASE (e.g., `RETENTION_DAYS`)

### Performance Considerations
[Source: architecture/security-and-performance.md]

**Storage Management Performance:**
- Asynchronous storage operations for non-blocking cleanup
- Efficient compression algorithms for storage optimization
- Batch processing for retention policy enforcement
- Storage monitoring with minimal performance impact
- Configurable storage operation intervals for resource optimization

### Storage Optimization Strategies
[Source: architecture/database-schema.md]

**Storage Optimization:**
- Data compression for long-term storage efficiency
- Index optimization and maintenance for query performance
- Garbage collection and cleanup automation
- Storage health monitoring and diagnostics
- Capacity planning and growth projection

### Disaster Recovery
[Source: architecture/development-workflow.md]

**Backup and Recovery Procedures:**
- **Automated Backups:** Daily automated backups with verification
- **Backup Retention:** 30-day backup retention with compression
- **Restore Procedures:** Documented restore procedures and testing
- **Disaster Recovery:** Complete system recovery procedures
- **Backup Monitoring:** Backup success monitoring and alerting
