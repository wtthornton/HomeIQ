}
```

### Backup and Restore Strategy
[Source: architecture/development-workflow.md]

**Backup Implementation:**
- **Database Backup:** InfluxDB backup tools for data export
- **Volume Backup:** Docker volume backup for persistent data
- **Configuration Backup:** Application configuration and settings
- **Backup Verification:** Integrity checking and validation

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

**Storage Management Test Organization:**
```
services/admin-api/tests/
├── test_retention_policies.py
├── test_storage_monitoring.py
├── test_data_compression.py
├── test_backup_restore.py
└── test_storage_optimization.py
```

**Test Examples:**
```python
import pytest
import asyncio
from services.admin_api.src.retention_service import RetentionService
from services.admin_api.src.storage_service import StorageService

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_retention_policy_enforcement():
    retention_service = RetentionService()
    
    # Test retention policy creation and enforcement
    await retention_service.create_retention_policy(
        name="test_policy",
        duration_days=30,
        shard_duration_days=7
    )
    
    # Verify policy is active
    policies = await retention_service.get_active_policies()
    assert any(policy.name == "test_policy" for policy in policies)
    
    # Test data cleanup
    cleanup_result = await retention_service.cleanup_expired_data()
    assert cleanup_result.records_deleted >= 0

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_storage_monitoring():
    storage_service = StorageService()
    
    # Test storage metrics collection
    metrics = await storage_service.get_storage_metrics()
    
    assert metrics.database_size_bytes > 0
    assert metrics.storage_usage_percent >= 0
    assert metrics.storage_usage_percent <= 100
    assert metrics.retention_compliance_percent >= 0
    assert metrics.retention_compliance_percent <= 100
```

### Coding Standards
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

**Critical Rules:**
- **Data Safety:** All retention operations must be validated before execution
- **Backup Integrity:** All backups must be verified for integrity
- **Error Handling:** All storage operations must handle failures gracefully
- **Naming Conventions:** 
  - Functions: snake_case (e.g., `cleanup_expired_data()`)
  - Storage Metrics: snake_case (e.g., `database_size_bytes`)
  - Configuration: UPPER_CASE (e.g., `RETENTION_DAYS`)

### Performance Considerations
[Source: architecture/security-and-performance.md]

**Storage Management Performance:**
- Asynchronous storage operations for non-blocking cleanup
- Efficient compression algorithms for storage optimization
- Batch processing for retention policy enforcement
- Storage monitoring with minimal performance impact
- Configurable storage operation intervals for resource optimization

### Storage Optimization Strategies
[Source: architecture/database-schema.md]

**Storage Optimization:**
- Data compression for long-term storage efficiency
- Index optimization and maintenance for query performance
- Garbage collection and cleanup automation
- Storage health monitoring and diagnostics
- Capacity planning and growth projection

### Disaster Recovery
[Source: architecture/development-workflow.md]

**Backup and Recovery Procedures:**
- **Automated Backups:** Daily automated backups with verification
- **Backup Retention:** 30-day backup retention with compression

### **🎯 Gate Decision**

**Status**: **CONCERNS** ⚠️  
**Rationale**: Story 4.2 has excellent documentation and requirements but critical implementation gap. The data retention and storage management system is not implemented in the codebase, creating critical risks for data loss, storage capacity issues, and storage monitoring blindness. While the foundation exists in InfluxDB storage, the complete storage management framework needs implementation.

**Critical Issues:**
- ❌ **Data Retention Policy System**: Not implemented
- ❌ **Storage Usage Monitoring**: Missing storage tracking and capacity planning
- ❌ **Backup and Restore System**: No data protection capabilities
- ❌ **Storage Optimization**: No automated storage maintenance
- ❌ **Storage Analytics**: Missing storage metrics and trend analysis

**Recommendation**: **Requires Implementation** - Story needs complete data retention and storage management system implementation before proceeding to production.
