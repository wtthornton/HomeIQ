# Story 28.2: Health Score Calculation Algorithm

## Story Overview
**Story ID**: STORY-28.2  
**Epic**: EPIC-28 (Environment Health Monitoring System)  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Story Points**: 5  
**Sprint**: Sprint 2  

## User Story
**As a** HA Ingestor user  
**I want** a single health score that represents my environment's overall health  
**So that** I can quickly understand if my system is running optimally  

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Calculate health score based on multiple factors
- [ ] Weight different components appropriately (core HA, integrations, performance)
- [ ] Provide score breakdown with component details
- [ ] Update score in real-time as conditions change
- [ ] Display score with color coding (red/yellow/green)
- [ ] Show score history and trends
- [ ] Provide recommendations for improving score

## Technical Requirements
- Design health scoring algorithm
- Implement weighted component scoring
- Create score breakdown visualization
- Add real-time score updates
- Implement score history tracking
- Design recommendation engine
- Add score trend analysis

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Health scoring algorithm implemented
- [ ] Weighted component scoring working
- [ ] Score breakdown displayed
- [ ] Real-time updates functional
- [ ] Score history tracked
- [ ] Recommendations generated
- [ ] Trend analysis working
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing
- [ ] Algorithm validated with test data

## Dependencies
- Real-time health monitoring
- Environment health dashboard
- Performance metrics collection

## Risks
- **Risk**: Scoring algorithm complexity
  - **Mitigation**: Start with simple weighted average, iterate based on feedback
- **Risk**: Score not reflecting user experience
  - **Mitigation**: User feedback loop and algorithm tuning
