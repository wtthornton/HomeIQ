# Story 5.5: Frontend Build & Deployment

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As a** developer,  
**I want** automated frontend build and deployment,  
**so that** I can deploy the admin interface efficiently and reliably.

## Acceptance Criteria

2. Docker containerization packages the frontend for deployment
3. Environment-specific builds support development and production configurations
4. Build optimization minimizes bundle size and loading times
5. Automated deployment integrates with Docker Compose orchestration
6. Build artifacts are properly versioned and tagged
7. Build and deployment processes are documented and automated
