### Health Check Integration
[Source: architecture/data-models.md]

**Enhanced Health Check Response:**
```typescript
interface SystemHealth {
  service_status: ServiceStatus;
  event_stats: EventStats;
  connection_status: ConnectionStatus;
  system_metrics: SystemMetrics;
  last_updated: string;
}

interface SystemMetrics {
  cpu_usage_percent: number;
  memory_usage_mb: number;
  disk_usage_percent: number;
  network_io_bytes: number;
  log_rotation_status: 'healthy' | 'warning' | 'critical';
}
```

### Alerting System
[Source: architecture/monitoring-and-observability.md]

**Alert Types:**
- Service health alerts (service down, unhealthy)
- Performance alerts (high latency, low throughput)
- Error rate alerts (high error rate, validation failures)
- Resource alerts (high CPU, memory, disk usage)
- Log rotation alerts (disk space, log retention issues)

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

**Monitoring Test Organization:**
```
services/admin-api/tests/
├── test_logging_system.py
├── test_metrics_collection.py
├── test_health_checks.py
├── test_alerting_system.py
└── test_monitoring_integration.py
```

**Test Examples:**
```python
import pytest
import asyncio
from services.admin_api.src.logging_service import LoggingService
from services.admin_api.src.metrics_service import MetricsService

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_structured_logging():
    logging_service = LoggingService()
    
    # Test structured logging
    await logging_service.log_event(
        level="INFO",
        service="test-service",
        message="Test event processed",
        event_id="test_123"
    )
    
    # Verify log format and content
    logs = await logging_service.get_recent_logs(limit=1)
    assert logs[0]["level"] == "INFO"
    assert logs[0]["service"] == "test-service"
    assert "event_id" in logs[0]

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_metrics_collection():
    metrics_service = MetricsService()
    
    # Test metrics collection
    await metrics_service.record_event_processed("sensor.temperature", 45)
    await metrics_service.record_error("validation_failure")
    
    # Verify metrics calculation
    metrics = await metrics_service.get_current_metrics()
    assert metrics.events_processed > 0
    assert metrics.processing_latency_avg >= 0
    assert metrics.error_rate >= 0
```

### Coding Standards
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

**Critical Rules:**
- **Structured Logging:** All logs must use structured JSON format
- **Metrics Collection:** All performance metrics must be tracked
- **Error Handling:** All errors must be logged with context
- **Naming Conventions:** 
  - Functions: snake_case (e.g., `collect_metrics()`)
  - Log Fields: snake_case (e.g., `processing_time_ms`)
  - Configuration: UPPER_CASE (e.g., `LOG_LEVEL`)

### Performance Considerations
[Source: architecture/security-and-performance.md]

**Monitoring Performance:**
- Asynchronous logging to prevent blocking
- Efficient metrics collection with minimal overhead
- Log rotation and compression for disk space management
- Metrics aggregation and caching for dashboard performance
- Configurable monitoring intervals for resource optimization

### Log Rotation Strategy
[Source: architecture/development-workflow.md]

**Log Rotation Configuration:**
- **Max Size:** 100MB per log file
- **Rotation:** Daily rotation with compression
- **Retention:** 30 days with automatic cleanup
- **Compression:** gzip compression for archived logs
- **Monitoring:** Disk space monitoring and alerting

### Dashboard Integration
[Source: architecture/monitoring-and-observability.md]

**Monitoring Dashboard Features:**
- Real-time system health status
- Performance metrics visualization
- Error rate and trend analysis
- Log aggregation and search
- Alert status and history

### **🎯 Gate Decision**

**Status**: **CONCERNS** ⚠️  
**Rationale**: Story 4.1 has excellent documentation and requirements but critical implementation gap. The comprehensive logging and monitoring system is not implemented in the codebase, creating high risks for monitoring blindness, logging gaps, and alerting gaps. While the foundation exists in basic logging and health monitoring, the complete monitoring framework needs implementation.

**Critical Issues:**
- ❌ **Comprehensive Logging System**: Not implemented
- ❌ **Centralized Log Aggregation**: Missing log aggregation across services
- ❌ **Performance Metrics Collection**: No comprehensive metrics tracking
- ❌ **Monitoring Dashboard Backend**: Missing dashboard API endpoints
- ❌ **Configurable Alerting System**: No alerting system for critical issues

**Recommendation**: **Requires Implementation** - Story needs complete logging and monitoring system implementation before proceeding to production.
