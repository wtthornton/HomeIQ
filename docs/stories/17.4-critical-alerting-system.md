## 📊 Detailed Requirements

### 1. Alert Engine Implementation
**Alert Engine Core:**
```python
@dataclass
class Alert:
    id: str
    service: str
    alert_type: str
    severity: str  # critical, warning, info
    message: str
    timestamp: datetime
    status: str  # active, resolved, acknowledged
    resolution_notes: Optional[str]
    resolved_at: Optional[datetime]

class AlertEngine:
    def __init__(self):
        self.active_alerts = {}
        self.alert_rules = self.load_alert_rules()
    
    def evaluate_alerts(self, metrics: Dict[str, Any]):
        """Evaluate alert rules against current metrics"""
        for rule in self.alert_rules:
            if self.evaluate_rule(rule, metrics):
                self.trigger_alert(rule, metrics)
            else:
                self.resolve_alert(rule.id)
    
    def trigger_alert(self, rule: AlertRule, metrics: Dict[str, Any]):
        """Trigger an alert based on rule evaluation"""
        alert = Alert(
            id=rule.id,
            service=rule.service,
            alert_type=rule.alert_type,
            severity=rule.severity,
            message=rule.format_message(metrics),
            timestamp=datetime.utcnow(),
            status="active"
        )
        
        self.active_alerts[rule.id] = alert
        self.notify_alert(alert)
```

### 2. Alert Rules Configuration
**Alert Rules Structure:**
```python
@dataclass
class AlertRule:
    id: str
    name: str
    service: str
    alert_type: str
    severity: str
    condition: str  # metric comparison expression
    threshold: float
    duration: int  # seconds before triggering
    message_template: str
    enabled: bool

# Example Alert Rules
ALERT_RULES = [
    AlertRule(
        id="service_down",
        name="Service Unavailable",
        service="*",
        alert_type="health",
        severity="critical",
        condition="health_status != 'healthy'",
        threshold=1,
        duration=30,
        message_template="{service} is {health_status}",
        enabled=True
    ),
    AlertRule(
        id="high_response_time",
        name="High Response Time",
        service="*",
        alert_type="performance",
        severity="warning",
        condition="response_time_ms > threshold",
        threshold=1000,
        duration=60,
        message_template="{service} response time is {response_time_ms}ms",
        enabled=True
    ),
    AlertRule(
        id="high_cpu_usage",
        name="High CPU Usage",
        service="*",
        alert_type="resource",
        severity="warning",
        condition="cpu_usage_percent > threshold",
        threshold=80,
        duration=120,
        message_template="{service} CPU usage is {cpu_usage_percent}%",
        enabled=True
    ),
    AlertRule(
        id="database_connection_failed",
        name="Database Connection Failed",
        service="*",
        alert_type="dependency",
        severity="critical",
        condition="influxdb_status != 'healthy'",
        threshold=1,
        duration=10,
        message_template="Database connection failed for {service}",

  message: string;
  timestamp: string;
  status: 'active' | 'resolved' | 'acknowledged';
  duration: string;
  resolutionNotes?: string;
}

// Dashboard Alert Component
const AlertPanel: React.FC = () => {
  const [alerts, setAlerts] = useState<AlertDisplay[]>([]);
  
  return (
    <div className="alert-panel">
      <h3>Active Alerts</h3>
      {alerts.map(alert => (
        <AlertCard
          key={alert.id}
          alert={alert}
          onAcknowledge={handleAcknowledge}
          onResolve={handleResolve}
        />
      ))}
    </div>
  );
};
```

### 5. Alert Management System
**Alert Management Features:**
- **Alert Acknowledgment**: Mark alerts as acknowledged
- **Alert Resolution**: Mark alerts as resolved with notes
- **Alert History**: View historical alerts and resolutions
- **Alert Statistics**: Alert frequency and resolution metrics

**Alert Management API:**
```python
class AlertManager:
    def acknowledge_alert(self, alert_id: str, user: str):
        """Acknowledge an active alert"""
        if alert_id in self.active_alerts:
            alert = self.active_alerts[alert_id]
            alert.status = "acknowledged"
            alert.acknowledged_by = user
            alert.acknowledged_at = datetime.utcnow()
    
    def resolve_alert(self, alert_id: str, resolution_notes: str, user: str):
        """Resolve an active alert"""
        if alert_id in self.active_alerts:
            alert = self.active_alerts[alert_id]
            alert.status = "resolved"
            alert.resolution_notes = resolution_notes
            alert.resolved_by = user
            alert.resolved_at = datetime.utcnow()
            del self.active_alerts[alert_id]
    
    def get_alert_history(self, service: str = None, days: int = 7):
        """Get historical alerts"""
        # Retrieve alert history from storage
        pass
```
