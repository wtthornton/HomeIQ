# Story 10.2: NFL Client Implementation

**Status:** Ready for Review  
**Epic:** 10 - Sports API Integration  
**Story Points:** 13  
**Priority:** High  
**Dependencies:** 10.1 (Sports API Service Foundation)

---

## Story

**As a** sports data consumer,  
**I want** a comprehensive NFL API client that fetches live scores, standings, fixtures, players, and injury reports,  
**so that** I can access real-time and historical NFL data for Home Assistant automations and analytics.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. ✅ `NFLClient` class extends `APISportsClient` with NFL-specific methods
2. ✅ Pydantic data models created for all NFL data types (Score, Standing, Player, Injury, Fixture)
3. ✅ `get_scores()` method fetches live or historical scores
4. ✅ `get_standings()` method fetches league standings by season
5. ✅ `get_fixtures()` method fetches upcoming games schedule
6. ✅ `get_players()` method fetches player statistics
7. ✅ `get_injuries()` method fetches injury reports
8. ✅ All methods handle API errors gracefully with proper logging
9. ✅ Unit tests cover all methods with mock API responses
10. ✅ Integration tests validate API call structure
11. ✅ Response validation using Pydantic models
12. ✅ Test coverage > 90%

### Architecture References

**NFL Client Implementation** (from `docs/architecture/sports-api-integration.md`, Section 4.3):

```python
class NFLClient(APISportsClient):
    def __init__(self, api_key: str):
        super().__init__(api_key, "https://api-sports.io/nfl")
    
    async def get_scores(
        self, 
        date: Optional[str] = None
    ) -> List[NFLScore]:
        """Get NFL scores for date or live scores"""
        params = {'date': date} if date else {'live': 'all'}
        data = await self._request('GET', '/scores', params=params)
        return [NFLScore(**score) for score in data['response']]
    
    async def get_standings(self, season: int) -> List[NFLStanding]:
        """Get NFL standings for season"""
        data = await self._request(
            'GET', 
            '/standings', 
            params={'season': season}
        )
        return [NFLStanding(**s) for s in data['response']]
```

**Pydantic Models** (from architecture document, Section 4.6):

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from typing import Optional, Dict, Any
from datetime import datetime

class NFLScore(BaseModel):
    game_id: str
    date: datetime
    home_team: str
    away_team: str
    home_score: Optional[int] = None
    away_score: Optional[int] = None
    status: str  # scheduled, live, finished
    quarter: Optional[str] = None
    time_remaining: Optional[str] = None
    season: int
    week: int

class NFLStanding(BaseModel):
    team: str
    conference: str
    division: str
    wins: int
    losses: int
    ties: int
    win_percentage: float
    points_for: int
    points_against: int
    season: int

class NFLPlayer(BaseModel):
    player_id: str
    name: str
    position: str
    team: str
    stats: Dict[str, Any]

class NFLInjury(BaseModel):
    player_id: str
    player_name: str
    team: str
    injury_type: str
    status: str  # out, doubtful, questionable, probable
    updated: datetime
```

### API-SPORTS NFL Endpoints

**Base URL**: `https://api-sports.io/nfl`

**Scores Endpoint**:
- Live: `GET /scores?live=all`
- Historical: `GET /scores?date=YYYY-MM-DD`
- Response: Array of game objects with scores and status

**Standings Endpoint**:
- `GET /standings?season=YYYY`
- Response: Array of team standings with W/L records

**Fixtures Endpoint**:
- Full season: `GET /fixtures?season=YYYY`
- Specific week: `GET /fixtures?season=YYYY&week=N`
- Response: Array of scheduled games

**Players Endpoint**:
- Team roster: `GET /players?team=TEAM_NAME`
- Specific player: `GET /players?id=PLAYER_ID`
- Response: Array of player objects with stats

**Injuries Endpoint**:
- League-wide: `GET /injuries`
- Team-specific: `GET /injuries?team=TEAM_NAME`
- Response: Array of injury reports

### Important Implementation Notes

1. **Response Parsing**: API-SPORTS wraps responses in `{'response': [...]}`
2. **Date Format**: Use ISO format `YYYY-MM-DD` for dates
3. **Live Scores**: Use `{'live': 'all'}` param for live games only
4. **Error Handling**: Return empty lists on errors, don't propagate exceptions
5. **Validation**: Let Pydantic raise ValidationError, catch and log it
6. **Logging**: Use structured logging with correlation IDs
7. **Rate Limiting**: Inherited from base client, no additional work needed

### Testing

**Mock API Response Examples**:

```python
# Mock NFL Scores Response
mock_scores_response = {
    'response': [
        {
            'game_id': '12345',
            'date': '2025-10-11T18:00:00Z',
            'home_team': 'Patriots',
            'away_team': 'Chiefs',
            'home_score': 24,
            'away_score': 21,
            'status': 'finished',
            'quarter': None,
            'time_remaining': None,
            'season': 2025,
            'week': 5
        }
    ]
}

# Mock NFL Standings Response
mock_standings_response = {
    'response': [
        {
            'team': 'Patriots',
            'conference': 'AFC',
            'division': 'East',
            'wins': 4,
            'losses': 1,
            'ties': 0,
            'win_percentage': 0.800,
            'points_for': 125,
            'points_against': 98,
            'season': 2025
        }
    ]
}
```

**Test Pattern**:

```python
import pytest
from unittest.mock import AsyncMock, patch
from src.nfl_client import NFLClient
from src.models import NFLScore

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_nfl_client_get_scores():
    """Test NFL client fetches scores correctly"""
    
    mock_response = {
        'response': [
            {
                'game_id': '123',
                'date': '2025-10-11T18:00:00Z',
                'home_team': 'Patriots',
                'away_team': 'Chiefs',
                'home_score': 24,
                'away_score': 21,
                'status': 'finished',
                'quarter': None,
                'time_remaining': None,
                'season': 2025,
                'week': 5
            }
        ]
    }
    
    client = NFLClient('test-api-key')
    
    with patch.object(client, '_request', new=AsyncMock(return_value=mock_response)):
        async with client:
            scores = await client.get_scores(date='2025-10-11')
            
            assert len(scores) == 1
            assert scores[0].game_id == '123'
            assert scores[0].home_team == 'Patriots'
            assert scores[0].home_score == 24
            assert isinstance(scores[0], NFLScore)
```

**Coverage Requirements**:
- All public methods tested
- Success and error scenarios
- Edge cases (empty responses, malformed data)
- Pydantic validation
- 90%+ coverage
