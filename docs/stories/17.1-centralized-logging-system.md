## 🏗️ Technical Implementation

### Architecture
```
Services → Docker Logging → Centralized Log Storage → Log Viewer
```

### Components
1. **Docker Logging Configuration**: Configure logging drivers for all services
2. **Log Aggregation Service**: Centralized log collection and storage
3. **Structured Logging**: JSON format with consistent fields
4. **Log Viewer**: Basic search and filtering interface in health dashboard

### Technology Choices
- **Logging Driver**: Docker's built-in logging drivers
- **Log Format**: Structured JSON with correlation IDs
- **Storage**: File-based with rotation (avoiding complex systems)
- **Viewer**: Enhanced health dashboard component

---

## 📊 Detailed Requirements

### 1. Docker Logging Configuration
**Files to Modify:**
- `docker-compose.yml` - Add logging configuration for all services
- `services/*/Dockerfile` - Ensure proper logging setup

**Configuration:**
```yaml
logging:
  driver: "json-file"
  options:
    max-size: "10m"
    max-file: "3"
    labels: "service,environment"
```

### 2. Structured Logging Implementation
**Python Services:**
- Update `shared/logging_config.py` with JSON formatter
- Add correlation ID support
- Standardize log fields across all services

**Node.js Services:**
- Update health-dashboard logging to use structured format
- Add correlation ID middleware
- Ensure consistent log structure

**Standard Log Format:**
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-10-12T22:58:40.583917Z",
  "level": "INFO",
  "service": "data-retention",
  "message": "Service started successfully",
  "correlation_id": "req-12345",
  "context": {
    "filename": "main.py",
    "lineno": 349,
    "function": "main"
  }
}
```

### 3. Log Aggregation Service
**New Component:**
- Simple log aggregation service using existing patterns
- File-based log collection (avoiding ELK stack complexity)
- Basic log rotation and retention

**Integration:**
- Integrate with existing health dashboard
- Provide log search and filtering capabilities
- Display recent logs in monitoring interface

### 4. Log Viewer Integration
**Health Dashboard Enhancement:**
- Add "Logs" tab to existing dashboard
- Basic search functionality (service, level, time range)
- Recent log display with filtering
- Log correlation ID tracking

4. Test structured logging across all services

### Step 3: Log Aggregation (Day 4-5)
1. Implement simple log aggregation service
2. Configure log rotation and retention policies
3. Test log collection and storage

### Step 4: Log Viewer (Day 6-7)
1. Add log viewer to health dashboard
2. Implement basic search and filtering
3. Test log viewing and correlation
4. Performance testing and optimization

## 📈 Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- **Log Coverage**: 100% of services sending structured logs
- **Performance Impact**: <5% increase in response times
- **Log Search Speed**: <2 seconds for basic queries
- **Storage Efficiency**: Log rotation prevents disk space issues

### Operational Metrics
- **Troubleshooting Time**: 50% reduction in issue resolution time
- **Log Accessibility**: All logs accessible from single interface
- **Correlation Capability**: Request tracing across service boundaries
- **Retention Compliance**: Logs retained according to policies

## 🚫 Non-Goals (Avoiding Over-Engineering)

### What We're NOT Doing
- Complex log analysis and search (Elasticsearch, Splunk)
- Advanced log parsing and extraction
- Machine learning-based log anomaly detection
- Complex log forwarding and routing
- Advanced log visualization and dashboards
- Real-time log streaming and processing

### Why These Are Out of Scope
- **Simplicity**: Focus on essential logging needs only
- **Performance**: Avoid complex systems that impact service performance
- **Maintenance**: Keep logging system simple and maintainable
- **Cost**: No additional infrastructure or licensing costs
- **Personal Project**: Appropriate scope for home automation system

---

## 🔍 Risk Assessment

### Low Risk
- **Technical Implementation**: Building on existing logging infrastructure
- **Integration**: Services already have logging, just need centralization
- **Performance**: Docker logging drivers are lightweight

### Medium Risk
- **Storage Management**: Log rotation needs proper configuration
- **Performance Impact**: Log aggregation overhead needs monitoring

### Mitigation Strategies
- Start with simple file-based aggregation
- Monitor performance impact during implementation
- Implement proper log rotation from the start
- Test with realistic log volumes
