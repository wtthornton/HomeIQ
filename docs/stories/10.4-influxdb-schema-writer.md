**Context7 KB InfluxDB Patterns** (from `docs/kb/context7-cache/influxdb-python-patterns.md`):

```python
from influxdb_client_3 import InfluxDBClient3, Point, WriteOptions, InfluxDBError
from influxdb_client_3 import write_client_options

# Batch Writing Pattern
write_options = WriteOptions(
    batch_size=100,
    flush_interval=10_000,  # 10 seconds
    jitter_interval=2_000,
    retry_interval=5_000,
    max_retries=5,
    max_retry_delay=30_000,
    exponential_base=2
)

wco = write_client_options(
    success_callback=callback.success,
    error_callback=callback.error,
    retry_callback=callback.retry,
    write_options=write_options
)

client = InfluxDBClient3(
    host="influxdb:8086",
    token="TOKEN",
    database="home_assistant",
    write_client_options=wco
)

# Writing Points
point = Point("measurement_name") \
    .tag("location", "london") \
    .tag("sensor_type", "temperature") \
    .field("temperature", 42.0) \
    .field("humidity", 65.0) \
    .time(datetime.now())

client.write(point)
```

### Implementation Pattern

**SportsInfluxDBWriter Class** (from architecture document):

```python
class SportsInfluxDBWriter:
    """High-performance batch writer for sports data"""
    
    def __init__(
        self,
        host: str,
        token: str,
        database: str,
        org: str,
        batch_size: int = 100,
        flush_interval: int = 10_000,
        max_retries: int = 5
    ):
        self.host = host
        self.token = token
        self.database = database
        self.org = org
        
        # Statistics
        self.total_points_written = 0
        self.total_batches_written = 0
        self.total_points_failed = 0
        
        # Callbacks
        self.callback = BatchingCallback()
        
        # Write options
        self.write_options = WriteOptions(
            batch_size=batch_size,
            flush_interval=flush_interval,
            jitter_interval=2_000,
            retry_interval=5_000,
            max_retries=max_retries,
            max_retry_delay=30_000,
            exponential_base=2
        )
        
        self.client: Optional[InfluxDBClient3] = None
    
    async def start(self):
        """Initialize InfluxDB client"""
        wco = write_client_options(
            success_callback=self.callback.success,
            error_callback=self.callback.error,
            retry_callback=self.callback.retry,
            write_options=self.write_options
        )
        
        self.client = InfluxDBClient3(
            host=self.host,
            token=self.token,
            database=self.database,
            org=self.org,
            write_client_options=wco
        )
```

### Important Implementation Notes

1. **Tag Cardinality**: Keep unique tag values <10K per tag (team names, conferences are low cardinality)
2. **Field Types**: Use appropriate types (int for scores, float for percentages, string for status)
3. **Timestamps**: Use game date/time for historical data, current time for live updates
4. **Batch Size**: 100 points balances performance and memory usage
5. **Flush Interval**: 10 seconds ensures timely writes for live data
6. **Error Handling**: Log errors but don't propagate (use callbacks)
7. **Performance**: Track write times to identify bottlenecks

### Testing

**Mock InfluxDB Client Pattern**:

```python
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_write_nfl_score():
    """Test writing NFL score to InfluxDB"""
    
    mock_client = Mock()
    mock_client.write = Mock()
    
    writer = SportsInfluxDBWriter(
        host="http://localhost:8086",
        token="test-token",
        database="test",
        org="test-org"
    )
    writer.client = mock_client
    
    score = {
        'game_id': '12345',
        'season': 2025,
        'week': 5,
        'home_team': 'Patriots',
        'away_team': 'Chiefs',
        'status': 'finished',
        'home_score': 24,
        'away_score': 21
    }
    
    result = await writer.write_nfl_score(score)
    
    assert result is True
    assert mock_client.write.called
    assert writer.total_points_written == 1
```
