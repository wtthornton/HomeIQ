# Story: Stabilization Plan Implementation

## Status
Draft

## Story

**As a** project stakeholder and system administrator,  
**I want** a comprehensive stabilization plan to address critical technical debt and implementation gaps,  
**so that** the system can achieve true production readiness and long-term maintainability.

## Acceptance Criteria

3. **AC3: Implementation Roadmap** - Detailed implementation roadmap with phases, dependencies, and timelines
4. **AC4: Resource Requirements** - Clear resource requirements (time, effort, skills) for each stabilization phase
5. **AC5: Success Metrics** - Defined success metrics and KPIs for measuring stabilization progress
6. **AC6: Monitoring Strategy** - Strategy for monitoring stabilization progress and system health improvements
7. **AC7: Rollback Plans** - Rollback and contingency plans for each stabilization phase
8. **AC8: Stakeholder Communication** - Communication plan for keeping stakeholders informed of progress

## Dev Notes

### Current System State Analysis

Based on the comprehensive health assessment conducted:

**System Health Status:**
- **Overall Status**: DEPLOYMENT READY (but with significant technical debt)
- **Success Rate**: 91.7% (11/12 tests passing)
- **Critical Issues**: 0 (all resolved in January 2025)
- **Warning Issues**: 1 (API endpoint 404 error - non-critical)

**Key Findings:**

1. **Critical Implementation Gaps Identified:**
   - **Data Quality Validation System**: Not implemented (Story 3.3 - CONCERNS status)
   - **Comprehensive Logging & Monitoring**: Not implemented (Story 4.1 - CONCERNS status)
   - **Quality Metrics Collection**: Missing comprehensive quality monitoring
   - **Validation Failure Alerting**: No alerting system implemented
   - **Quality Dashboard Backend**: Missing dashboard API endpoints

2. **Technical Debt Assessment:**
   - **Code Quality Score**: 35-45/100 for critical stories
   - **Test Coverage**: 0/0 tests for unimplemented systems
   - **NFR Compliance**: 15-25% for critical requirements
   - **Security Score**: 30-40/100 for monitoring systems
   - **Performance Score**: 25-30/100 for quality systems

3. **Risk Profile:**
   - **High Risk Items**: 3-4 critical risks identified
   - **Medium Risk Items**: 2-3 medium risks
   - **Low Risk Items**: 1-2 low risks
   - **Unmitigated Critical Risks**: Data quality blindness, monitoring gaps, alerting gaps

4. **System Architecture Status:**
   - **Core Services**: All 6 services operational and healthy
   - **API Endpoints**: 50+ endpoints implemented and functional
   - **Database**: InfluxDB healthy and operational
   - **Frontend**: Health dashboard operational
   - **Infrastructure**: Docker orchestration working correctly
