# Epic 10: Sports API Integration

**Status:** Approved  
**Priority:** High  
**Epic Owner:** Sarah (Product Owner)  
**Technical Lead:** Winston (Architect)  
**Created:** October 11, 2025

## Epic Overview

Integrate API-SPORTS (NFL, NCAA, and NHL) into the Home Assistant Ingestor ecosystem to provide real-time sports data enrichment for Home Assistant events. This enables users to create automations based on live game data, scores, standings, and player statistics.

### Business Value

- **User Automation**: Enable sports-based Home Assistant automations (e.g., "Turn on TV when my team plays")
- **Real-Time Data**: Live scores updated every ~15 seconds during games
- **Multi-Sport Support**: NFL, NHL, and future NCAA coverage
- **Historical Analysis**: Store and query historical sports data for trends and analytics

### Technical Context

This epic implements a new microservice following established patterns from weather-api and enrichment-pipeline services. The architecture leverages:

- **aiohttp** for async HTTP client with connection pooling (Context7 KB best practices)
- **InfluxDB** for time-series sports data storage with optimized schema
- **Rate limiting** with token bucket algorithm to manage API quotas
- **Intelligent caching** to minimize API calls and maximize free tier usage

**Architecture Document:** `docs/architecture/sports-api-integration.md`

---

## Epic Goals

1. ✅ **Service Foundation**: Create sports-api microservice with proper structure
2. ✅ **API Integration**: Implement NFL and NHL API clients with shared authentication
3. ✅ **Data Storage**: Design and implement optimized InfluxDB schema for sports data
4. ✅ **Performance**: Implement rate limiting, caching, and batch writing
5. ✅ **Integration**: Connect with enrichment pipeline for event enrichment
6. ✅ **Monitoring**: Add health checks, metrics, and observability
7. ✅ **Quality**: Comprehensive testing (unit, integration, E2E)

---

## Acceptance Criteria (Epic Level)

1. ✅ Sports API service deployed and running in Docker Compose
2. ✅ NFL and NHL live scores accessible via REST API
3. ✅ Sports data stored in InfluxDB with optimized schema
4. ✅ Rate limiting prevents API quota exhaustion
5. ✅ Cache hit rate > 60% for frequent queries
6. ✅ Health check endpoint returns service status
7. ✅ Unit test coverage > 90%
8. ✅ Integration tests pass for all API clients
9. ✅ Service integrates with enrichment pipeline
10. ✅ Documentation complete (architecture, API, deployment)

---

## Technical Constraints

1. **API Rate Limits**: Free tier typically 100-500 requests/day
2. **Update Cadence**: Live scores update every ~15 seconds
3. **Data Retention**: 2 years for events, 5 years for standings
4. **Response Time**: < 500ms for cached data, < 2s for API calls
5. **Availability**: 99% uptime excluding API-SPORTS outages

---

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies
- **API-SPORTS**: API key and service availability
- **InfluxDB**: Database running and configured
- **Docker**: Container orchestration

### Internal Dependencies
- **Shared Logging**: `shared/logging_config.py`
- **Enrichment Pipeline**: Integration point
- **Admin API**: Configuration management

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| API rate limit exhaustion | High | Medium | Intelligent caching, token bucket limiter |
| API-SPORTS service outage | Medium | Low | Circuit breaker, serve stale cache |
| InfluxDB write performance | Medium | Low | Batch writing, connection pooling |
| Schema design requires changes | Medium | Low | Versioned schema, migration support |
| Free tier insufficient | Low | Medium | Monitor usage, upgrade plan if needed |

## Notes

- Architecture designed by Winston (Architect) using Context7 KB for best practices
- Follows existing patterns from weather-api and enrichment-pipeline services
- Phase 1 uses in-memory caching; Phase 2 will add Redis
- NCAA support deferred to Phase 2 (future epic)
- Consider MLB, NBA, MLS in Phase 3 based on user demand
