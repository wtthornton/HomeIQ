### Smoke Test Example

```python
import asyncio
import aiohttp
import sys

async def smoke_test():
    """Run smoke tests against deployed service"""
    
    base_url = "http://sports-api:8010"
    
    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
        # Test health check
        async with session.get(f"{base_url}/health") as resp:
            assert resp.status == 200
            data = await resp.json()
            assert data['status'] == 'healthy'
            print("✓ Health check passed")
        
        # Test NFL scores endpoint
        async with session.get(f"{base_url}/api/nfl/scores") as resp:
            assert resp.status in [200, 503]  # 503 if API key not configured
            print("✓ NFL scores endpoint responsive")
        
        # Test NHL scores endpoint
        async with session.get(f"{base_url}/api/nhl/scores") as resp:
            assert resp.status in [200, 503]
            print("✓ NHL scores endpoint responsive")
    
    print("\n✅ All smoke tests passed")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        asyncio.run(smoke_test())
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"\n❌ Smoke test failed: {e}")
        sys.exit(1)
```
