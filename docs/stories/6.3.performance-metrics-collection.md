# Story 6.3: Performance Metrics Collection

## Status
Draft

## Story

**As a** system administrator and operations team,  
**I want** comprehensive performance metrics collection and storage for all services,  
**so that** I can monitor system performance, identify bottlenecks, and ensure optimal system operation with real-time visibility into system health and performance trends.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **AC1: Service Performance Metrics** - All services collect and report performance metrics (response times, throughput, error rates, resource usage)
2. **AC2: System Resource Metrics** - System-level metrics are collected (CPU, memory, disk usage, network I/O) for all services and infrastructure
3. **AC3: Application Metrics** - Custom application metrics are collected (business metrics, user activity, data processing rates)
4. **AC4: Database Performance Metrics** - Database performance metrics are collected (query times, connection pools, transaction rates)
5. **AC5: Metrics Storage and Retention** - All metrics are stored in InfluxDB with configurable retention policies and efficient storage
6. **AC6: Real-time Metrics Collection** - Metrics are collected in real-time with minimal performance impact on services
7. **AC7: Metrics API and Access** - REST API endpoints provide access to metrics data for dashboards and external systems
8. **AC8: Metrics Validation and Quality** - All metrics are validated for accuracy, completeness, and consistency

### Metrics Collection Framework

**Core Metrics Collector:**
```python
class MetricsCollector:
    def __init__(self, service_name: str, influxdb_client):
        self.service_name = service_name
        self.influxdb_client = influxdb_client
        self.metrics_buffer = []
    
    def record_timing(self, operation: str, duration_ms: float, tags: dict = None):
        """Record timing metric for an operation"""
        pass
    
    def record_counter(self, metric_name: str, value: int, tags: dict = None):
        """Record counter metric"""
        pass
    
    def record_gauge(self, metric_name: str, value: float, tags: dict = None):
        """Record gauge metric"""
        pass
    
    def record_error(self, operation: str, error_type: str, tags: dict = None):
        """Record error metric"""
        pass
```

**Performance Monitoring Decorator:**
```python
def monitor_performance(operation_name: str):
    def decorator(func):
        @wraps(func)
        async def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            start_time = time.time()
            try:
                result = await func(*args, **kwargs)
                duration_ms = (time.time() - start_time) * 1000
                metrics.record_timing(operation_name, duration_ms, {"status": "success"})
                return result
            except Exception as e:
                duration_ms = (time.time() - start_time) * 1000
                metrics.record_timing(operation_name, duration_ms, {"status": "error"})
                metrics.record_error(operation_name, type(e).__name__)
                raise
        return wrapper
    return decorator
```
