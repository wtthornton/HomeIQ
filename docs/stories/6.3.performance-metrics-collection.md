# Story 6.3: Performance Metrics Collection

## Status
Draft

## Story

**As a** system administrator and operations team,  
**I want** comprehensive performance metrics collection and storage for all services,  
**so that** I can monitor system performance, identify bottlenecks, and ensure optimal system operation with real-time visibility into system health and performance trends.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **AC1: Service Performance Metrics** - All services collect and report performance metrics (response times, throughput, error rates, resource usage)
2. **AC2: System Resource Metrics** - System-level metrics are collected (CPU, memory, disk usage, network I/O) for all services and infrastructure
3. **AC3: Application Metrics** - Custom application metrics are collected (business metrics, user activity, data processing rates)
4. **AC4: Database Performance Metrics** - Database performance metrics are collected (query times, connection pools, transaction rates)
5. **AC5: Metrics Storage and Retention** - All metrics are stored in InfluxDB with configurable retention policies and efficient storage
6. **AC6: Real-time Metrics Collection** - Metrics are collected in real-time with minimal performance impact on services
7. **AC7: Metrics API and Access** - REST API endpoints provide access to metrics data for dashboards and external systems
8. **AC8: Metrics Validation and Quality** - All metrics are validated for accuracy, completeness, and consistency

## Dev Notes

### Current State
**Foundation**: InfluxDB available, basic health check endpoints, service uptime monitoring

**Target Architecture**: Services → Comprehensive Metrics → InfluxDB Storage → Metrics API → Dashboards

### Implementation Strategy
1. **Core Framework**: Shared metrics collection framework and performance decorators
2. **Service Metrics**: Performance metrics for each service and system resource monitoring
3. **Storage & API**: InfluxDB optimization and metrics API endpoints

### Metrics Categories
- **Service Performance**: Request/response times, throughput, error rates, availability
- **System Resources**: CPU, memory, disk, network usage
- **Application Metrics**: Events processed, API calls, enrichment success rates
- **Database Metrics**: Query times, connection pools, transaction rates

### Key Files
**New**: `shared/metrics_collector.py`, `shared/performance_monitor.py`, `shared/system_metrics.py`
**Modify**: Service main.py files, docker-compose.yml, InfluxDB configuration

### Metrics Collection Framework
**Core Components**:
- MetricsCollector class for timing, counter, and gauge metrics
- Performance monitoring decorators for automatic timing
- System resource monitoring with psutil
- InfluxDB integration for metrics storage

### InfluxDB Schema Design
**Measurements**: service_performance, system_resources, application_metrics, database_metrics
**Tags**: service, operation, status, resource_type, metric_type
**Fields**: Numeric values for metrics (timing, counters, gauges)

### Configuration Requirements
**Environment Variables**: METRICS_ENABLED, METRICS_COLLECTION_INTERVAL, METRICS_RETENTION_DAYS

### Metrics API Design
**Endpoints**: /api/v1/metrics/performance/{service}, /api/v1/metrics/resources/{service}, /api/v1/metrics/application/{metric_type}

### Performance & Security
- Asynchronous collection with minimal overhead (<5%)
- InfluxDB optimization and retention policies
- Secure transmission and access control
- Data sanitization for sensitive metrics
