# Story AI5.1: Quick Weather Context Integration for Ask AI

**Story ID**: AI5.1  
**Title**: Quick Weather Context Integration for Ask AI  
**Epic**: AI-5  
**Phase**: 1  
**Priority**: High  
**Estimated Points**: 2  
**Story Type**: Foundation  
**Dependencies**: None  
**Vertical Slice**: Users get weather-aware automation suggestions when querying about climate devices  
**AI Agent Scope**: 2-4 hours - Add weather context detection and integration to existing Ask AI router  
**Created**: December 19, 2024  
**Last Updated**: December 19, 2024  

## User Story

As a **user**, I want my Ask AI queries about climate devices to include weather-aware suggestions so that I get immediate value from contextual intelligence.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Ask AI router detects climate-related entities in user queries
- [ ] Weather context is automatically included for climate device queries
- [ ] Weather suggestions are generated using existing `WeatherOpportunityDetector`
- [ ] Weather suggestions are formatted to match existing Ask AI suggestion format
- [ ] Weather suggestions are clearly labeled as "weather-aware"

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] Code follows Python best practices
- [ ] Weather context adds <50ms to query response time
- [ ] Error handling implemented for weather detector failures
- [ ] Unit tests written with >90% coverage
- [ ] Integration tests cover Ask AI router with weather context

## Implementation Details

### Files to Modify
- `services/ai-automation-service/src/api/ask_ai_router.py`
- `services/ai-automation-service/src/contextual_patterns/__init__.py`

### Key Implementation Points
- **Detection Logic**: Identify climate entities (`climate.*` domain)
- **Weather Integration**: Use existing `WeatherOpportunityDetector` with 1-day lookback
- **Suggestion Format**: Convert weather opportunities to Ask AI suggestion format
- **Performance**: Minimal impact on existing query performance
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback if weather context fails

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Climate entity detection implemented
- [ ] Weather context integration working
- [ ] Performance requirements met
- [ ] Weather suggestions properly formatted
- [ ] Error handling implemented
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing
- [ ] User acceptance testing completed

## Testing

### Unit Tests
- Test climate entity detection
- Test weather context integration
- Test suggestion formatting
- Test error handling

### Integration Tests
- Test Ask AI router with weather context
- Test performance requirements
- Test error scenarios

### User Acceptance Testing
- Test climate device queries include weather suggestions
- Test weather suggestions are clearly labeled
- Test response time requirements met

## Risks

- **Performance Impact**: Weather context may add latency
- **Error Handling**: Weather detector may fail
- **Integration Complexity**: May require changes to existing code

## Mitigation

- **Performance**: Use 1-day lookback instead of 7-day
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback to existing suggestions
- **Integration**: Minimal changes to existing code structure
