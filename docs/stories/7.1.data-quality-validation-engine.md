# Story 7.1: Data Quality Validation Engine

## Story Overview
**Story ID**: 7.1  
**Story Title**: Data Quality Validation Engine  
**Story Type**: Feature  
**Story Priority**: P0 - CRITICAL  
**Story Effort**: 2-3 days  
**Story Status**: Draft  
**Story Epic**: Epic 7 - Quality Monitoring Stabilization  

## Story Description
**As a** system administrator,  
**I want** a comprehensive data quality validation engine,  
**so that** I can ensure data integrity and detect quality issues before they impact the system.

## Business Justification
Current system lacks comprehensive data quality validation, creating risks for data corruption and unreliable analytics. This story addresses critical quality validation gaps.

## User Story
**As a** system administrator,  
**I want** to validate incoming data quality automatically,  
**so that** I can prevent bad data from entering the system and ensure reliable analytics.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **AC1: Data Validation Framework** - Configurable data validation framework operational
2. **AC2: Validation Rules Engine** - Validation rules engine with common data quality checks
3. **AC3: Validation Results Storage** - Validation results stored and accessible
4. **AC4: Validation Performance** - Validation adds <10ms overhead per message
5. **AC5: Validation Metrics** - Validation metrics collected and reported

## Story Tasks
- [ ] **Task 1: Validation Framework Implementation**
  - [ ] Create configurable validation framework
  - [ ] Implement validation rule engine
  - [ ] Add validation result storage
  - [ ] Configure validation performance monitoring

- [ ] **Task 2: Common Validation Rules**
  - [ ] Implement data type validation
  - [ ] Add data range validation
  - [ ] Implement required field validation
  - [ ] Add data format validation

- [ ] **Task 3: Validation Integration**
  - [ ] Integrate with existing DataNormalizer
  - [ ] Add validation to data ingestion pipeline
  - [ ] Implement validation result logging
  - [ ] Add validation metrics collection

## Technical Requirements
- Configurable validation framework
- Common data quality validation rules
- Validation result storage and reporting
- Performance monitoring for validation overhead
- Integration with existing data pipeline

## Dependencies
- Phase 1 completion (logging and metrics infrastructure)
- Existing DataNormalizer class
- InfluxDB for validation metrics storage

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Validation framework implemented and tested
- [ ] Common validation rules operational
- [ ] Validation results stored and accessible
- [ ] Performance requirements met (<10ms overhead)
- [ ] Validation metrics collected
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] Documentation updated

## Dev Notes
### Implementation Approach
1. **Build on Existing**: Enhance DataNormalizer class with validation framework
2. **Configurable Rules**: Create flexible validation rule configuration
3. **Performance Focus**: Ensure validation doesn't impact throughput
4. **Metrics Integration**: Use existing metrics collection for validation data

### Key Components
- Validation framework with configurable rules
- Common validation rules (type, range, required, format)
- Validation result storage and reporting
- Performance monitoring and metrics
