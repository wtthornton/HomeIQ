# Story: Dashboard Monitoring Components Enhancement

## Story Information
- **Epic**: Dashboard UX Improvements
- **Story Number**: dashboard-001
- **Story Title**: Enhance Database Storage, Error Rate, and Weather API Calls Components
- **Priority**: High
- **Story Points**: 8
- **Assignee**: BMAD Master Agent

## User Story
As a **system administrator** monitoring the HA Ingestor system, I want **enhanced dashboard components** for Database Storage, Error Rate, and Weather API Calls so that I can **quickly identify issues, understand system performance trends, and take proactive actions**.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Database Storage Component
- [ ] Shows real-time connection status with visual indicators
- [ ] Displays write operations per minute with trend arrows
- [ ] Shows storage utilization and response times
- [ ] Provides error categorization and historical trends
- [ ] Includes performance health indicators

### Error Rate Component
- [ ] Displays trend visualization with up/down/stable indicators
- [ ] Shows error categorization (network, processing, validation)
- [ ] Provides visual alerts when error rates exceed thresholds
- [ ] Includes actionable insights and recommendations
- [ ] Shows historical context and patterns

### Weather API Calls Component
- [ ] Displays API calls per hour/day with trend visualization
- [ ] Shows cache hit rates and efficiency metrics
- [ ] Includes API response times and success rates
- [ ] Provides quota tracking and usage indicators
- [ ] Shows service health and availability status

## Technical Requirements
- Use Context7 KB research for best practices
- Implement enhanced StatusCard and MetricCard components
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing API
- Follow BMAD architecture patterns
- Include comprehensive error handling
- Implement real-time updates with graceful degradation

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Components tested in development environment
- [ ] Visual design matches Context7 best practices
- [ ] Error handling implemented and tested
- [ ] Performance optimizations applied
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Code review completed

## Dependencies
- Admin API health endpoints
- Statistics endpoints
- Context7 KB research completed
- Existing dashboard architecture

## Risks
- API endpoint changes may require backend updates
- Real-time updates may impact performance
- Browser compatibility for new visual features

## Notes
Based on Context7 KB research using Tremor React and HA Component Kit patterns for enhanced dashboard components.
