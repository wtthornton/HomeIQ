# Story 1.3: Advanced Data Visualization

## Story Overview

**As a** system administrator,  
**I want** interactive charts with zoom, pan, and filtering capabilities,  
**so that** I can analyze data more effectively and gain deeper insights.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. All charts support zoom, pan, and drill-down functionality
2. Interactive filtering and time range selection is available
3. Chart data can be exported in multiple formats
4. Real-time chart updates maintain interactivity
5. Performance is maintained with large datasets

## Integration Verification

**IV1**: Existing chart data sources and API calls continue to work  
**IV2**: Current chart styling and theming is preserved  
**IV3**: Real-time updates function correctly with interactive features

## Technical Requirements

### Interactive Chart Components
- Enhance existing MetricsChart component with Chart.js v4 interactivity
- Implement zoom and pan using Chart.js interaction options:
  ```javascript
  options: {
    interaction: {
      mode: 'nearest',
      intersect: true,
      axis: 'xy'
    },
    plugins: {
      zoom: {
        zoom: {
          wheel: { enabled: true },
          pinch: { enabled: true },
          mode: 'xy'
        },
        pan: {
          enabled: true,
          mode: 'xy'
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```
- Add drill-down capabilities using Chart.js click events
- Implement custom plugins for enhanced interactivity:
  ```javascript
  const chartAreaBorder = {
    id: 'chartAreaBorder',
    beforeDraw(chart, args, options) {
      const {ctx, chartArea: {left, top, width, height}} = chart;
      ctx.save();
      ctx.strokeStyle = options.borderColor;
      ctx.lineWidth = options.borderWidth;
      ctx.strokeRect(left, top, width, height);
      ctx.restore();
    }
  };
  ```
- Ensure smooth performance with large datasets using Chart.js optimization

### Filtering System
- Implement time range selection controls
- Add data filtering options (entity type, event type, etc.)
- Create filter persistence across chart interactions
- Ensure filters work with real-time data updates

### Export Functionality
- Add chart data export in CSV, JSON, and PDF formats
- Implement export controls in chart toolbar
- Ensure export works with filtered data
- Maintain export performance with large datasets

### Real-time Integration
- Ensure interactive features work with real-time updates
- Implement smooth data transitions during updates
- Maintain chart state during data refreshes
- Preserve user interactions during updates

### Performance Optimization
- Implement data virtualization for large datasets
- Add chart rendering optimization
- Ensure smooth interactions on all devices
- Maintain performance with multiple charts

## Dependencies

- **Prerequisites**: Story 1.1 (Foundation and Navigation)
- **Blocks**: Story 1.6 (Data Export and Historical Analysis)
- **External**: Chart.js, existing data APIs, export libraries

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Interactive chart components implemented
- [ ] Zoom, pan, and drill-down functionality working
- [ ] Filtering system complete
- [ ] Export functionality implemented
- [ ] Real-time updates preserved
- [ ] Performance optimized
- [ ] All existing chart functionality maintained
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved

## Implementation Notes

- Extend existing MetricsChart component rather than replacing
- Use Chart.js plugins for interactivity features
- Implement progressive enhancement for export features
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing chart configurations
- Test with various data sizes and update frequencies

## Risk Mitigation

- Test interactive features with existing data sources
- Ensure chart performance doesn't degrade with real-time updates
- Implement fallback for unsupported export formats
- Maintain existing chart styling and theming
- Test with large datasets to ensure performance
