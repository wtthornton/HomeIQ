## 📊 Detailed Requirements

### 1. Quality Metrics Collector
**New Component**: `services/enrichment-pipeline/src/quality_metrics.py`

**Metrics Collected:**
- Validation success/failure rates per entity type
- Validation success/failure rates per validation rule
- Overall data quality score
- Validation performance metrics (time per validation)
- Invalid data volume and patterns

**Metrics Structure:**
```python
@dataclass
class QualityMetrics:
    timestamp: datetime
    entity_type: str
    validation_rule: str
    success_count: int
    failure_count: int
    success_rate: float
    avg_validation_time_ms: float
    quality_score: float
```

### 2. Metrics Calculation Logic
**Quality Score Calculation:**
- **Overall Score**: Weighted average of all validation success rates
- **Entity Type Scores**: Success rates per entity type
- **Rule Scores**: Success rates per validation rule
- **Trend Analysis**: Quality score changes over time

**Example Calculation:**
```python
class QualityCalculator:
    def calculate_quality_score(self, metrics: List[QualityMetrics]) -> float:
        """Calculate overall quality score from metrics"""
        if not metrics:
            return 0.0
        
        total_success = sum(m.success_count for m in metrics)
        total_attempts = sum(m.success_count + m.failure_count for m in metrics)
        
        if total_attempts == 0:
            return 0.0
        
        return (total_success / total_attempts) * 100
```

### 3. InfluxDB Schema for Quality Metrics
**Measurement Structure:**
```python
# InfluxDB measurement: data_quality_metrics
{
    "measurement": "data_quality_metrics",
    "tags": {
        "entity_type": "sensor",
        "validation_rule": "numeric_range",
        "service": "enrichment-pipeline"
    },
    "fields": {
        "success_count": 150,
        "failure_count": 5,
        "success_rate": 96.8,
        "avg_validation_time_ms": 2.5,
        "quality_score": 96.8
    },
    "timestamp": "2025-10-12T22:58:40Z"
}
```

**Retention Policy:**
- **Raw Metrics**: 30 days retention
- **Aggregated Metrics**: 1 year retention (daily aggregates)
- **Quality Scores**: 2 years retention (daily scores)

### 4. Metrics Collection Integration
**Integration Points:**
- Validation engine calls metrics collector after each validation
- Metrics collector aggregates results and stores in InfluxDB
- Quality calculator processes metrics and updates scores
- Metrics API provides access to quality data

**Collection Flow:**
```python
def collect_validation_metrics(event: dict, validation_result: ValidationResult):
    """Collect metrics after validation"""
    metrics = QualityMetrics(
        timestamp=datetime.utcnow(),
        entity_type=extract_entity_type(event),
        validation_rule=validation_result.rule_name,
        success_count=1 if validation_result.is_valid else 0,
        failure_count=0 if validation_result.is_valid else 1,
        success_rate=100.0 if validation_result.is_valid else 0.0,
        avg_validation_time_ms=validation_result.validation_time_ms,
        quality_score=calculate_entity_quality_score(event)
    )
    
    # Store metrics in InfluxDB
    store_quality_metrics(metrics)
```
