# Story 1.2: Preset Dashboard Layouts

## Story Overview

**As a** system administrator,  
**I want** to choose from preset dashboard layouts,  
**so that** I can quickly switch between different monitoring views optimized for different scenarios.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Multiple preset dashboard layouts are available (Overview, Detailed, Mobile)
2. Users can switch between layouts with a simple selector
3. Each layout is optimized for specific monitoring scenarios
4. Layout selection is saved in user preferences
5. Default layout is preserved for new users

## Integration Verification

**IV1**: Existing dashboard components work within all preset layouts  
**IV2**: Current data loading and display functionality is preserved  
**IV3**: Layout switching doesn't disrupt real-time data updates

## Technical Requirements

### Layout System
- Create layout configuration system using TypeScript interfaces:
  ```tsx
  interface LayoutConfig {
    id: string;
    name: string;
    description: string;
    grid: {
      columns: number;
      rows: number;
      gap: number;
    };
    widgets: WidgetConfig[];
  }
  
  interface WidgetConfig {
    id: string;
    type: string;
    position: { x: number; y: number; w: number; h: number };
    props: Record<string, any>;
  }
  ```
- Implement layout switching mechanism with React state management
- Use CSS Grid for responsive layout system:
  ```css
  .dashboard-grid {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(var(--columns), 1fr);
    gap: var(--gap);
    height: 100vh;
  }
  ```
- Ensure all existing components work within new layouts
- Maintain responsive design across all layouts

### Preset Layouts
- **Overview Layout**: High-level system status with key metrics
- **Detailed Layout**: Comprehensive monitoring with all available data
- **Mobile Layout**: Touch-optimized layout for mobile devices
- **Compact Layout**: Space-efficient layout for smaller screens

### Layout Management
- Implement layout selection UI component
- Add layout persistence to user preferences
- Ensure smooth transitions between layouts
- Maintain layout state during navigation

### Component Integration
- Ensure all existing dashboard components work in all layouts
- Implement responsive grid system for layout flexibility
- Maintain component functionality across layout changes
- Preserve real-time data updates during layout switching

## Dependencies

- **Prerequisites**: Story 1.1 (Foundation and Navigation)
- **Blocks**: Story 1.7 (Mobile Experience Enhancement)
- **External**: Existing dashboard components, user preferences system

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Layout configuration system implemented
- [ ] All preset layouts created and tested
- [ ] Layout switching mechanism working
- [ ] User preferences integration complete
- [ ] All existing components work in all layouts
- [ ] Responsive design maintained
- [ ] Real-time updates preserved
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved

## Implementation Notes

- Start with layout configuration system
- Create layout components that wrap existing dashboard components
- Implement smooth transitions between layouts
- Use CSS Grid or Flexbox for responsive layouts
- Ensure layout switching doesn't cause data reloading

## Risk Mitigation

- Test each layout individually before integration
- Ensure existing components don't break in new layouts
- Implement fallback to default layout if issues occur
- Maintain existing data flow patterns
- Test layout switching with real-time data updates
