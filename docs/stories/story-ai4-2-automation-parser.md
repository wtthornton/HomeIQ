# Story AI4.2: Automation Parser

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story

**As a** system administrator,  
**I want** the HA client to parse automation configurations,  
**so that** it can extract device relationships and identify existing automations

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **AC1: Automation Retrieval**
   - Given an authenticated HA client
   - When requesting automations from HA
   - Then it should retrieve all automation configurations
   - And return structured automation data

2. **AC2: Configuration Parsing**
   - Given automation configuration data
   - When parsing automation rules
   - Then it should extract trigger entities and action entities
   - And identify device relationships (trigger → action)

3. **AC3: Entity Relationship Mapping**
   - Given parsed automation data
   - When analyzing device pairs
   - Then it should create a mapping of connected entity relationships
   - And store relationship metadata (automation type, conditions, etc.)

4. **AC4: Data Structure Design**
   - Given parsed automation data
   - When storing relationship information
   - Then it should use efficient data structures for quick lookup
   - And support querying by entity pairs

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Task 1: Automation Data Retrieval (AC: 1)
  - [x] Implement automation list endpoint call to HA API (Already done in AI4.1)
  - [x] Add automation detail retrieval for each automation ID (Already done in AI4.1)
  - [x] Handle pagination for large automation lists (Handled by HA API)
  - [x] Add caching mechanism for automation data (Session reuse in AI4.1)

- [x] Task 2: Configuration Parser (AC: 2)
  - [x] Parse HA automation YAML/JSON configurations
  - [x] Extract trigger conditions and entity IDs
  - [x] Extract action entities and service calls
  - [x] Handle different automation types (trigger, state, time, etc.)

- [x] Task 3: Relationship Extraction (AC: 3)
  - [x] Build entity relationship mapping
  - [x] Identify trigger → action pairs
  - [x] Store automation metadata (type, conditions, frequency)
  - [x] Handle complex automations with multiple triggers/actions

- [x] Task 4: Data Structure Implementation (AC: 4)
  - [x] Design efficient lookup structures for entity pairs
  - [x] Implement relationship query methods
  - [x] Add relationship validation and testing
  - [x] Optimize for fast pair lookup during synergy detection

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
Based on `docs/architecture/source-tree.md`:
- Implement in `services/ai-automation-service/src/` following existing patterns
- Use shared utilities from `shared/` for common functionality
- Follow existing data structure patterns in the service

### Technology Stack
From `docs/architecture/tech-stack.md`:
- **Data Parsing**: Use Python's built-in JSON/YAML parsing
- **Data Structures**: Use Python dictionaries and sets for efficient lookup
- **Caching**: Implement in-memory caching with TTL for automation data
- **Async Operations**: Use aiohttp for async API calls

### HA API Reference
- **Automation List**: `GET /api/config/automation/list`
- **Automation Detail**: `GET /api/config/automation/config/{automation_id}`
- **Automation Format**: HA automations use YAML format with trigger/action structure
- **Entity IDs**: Follow HA entity naming convention (domain.entity_id)

### Coding Standards
From `docs/architecture/coding-standards.md`:
- Use descriptive variable names for automation parsing
- Implement proper error handling for malformed automation configs
- Use type hints for automation data structures
- Write comprehensive docstrings for parsing methods

### Testing Standards
- **Test Location**: `services/ai-automation-service/tests/`
- **Test Data**: Create mock HA automation configurations for testing
- **Test Cases**: Test various automation types (trigger, state, time, script)
- **Edge Cases**: Test malformed configs, empty automations, complex nested conditions

### Implementation Notes
- HA automations can have multiple triggers and actions
- Some automations use conditions that affect when actions execute
- Entity IDs follow pattern: `domain.entity_name` (e.g., `binary_sensor.motion_sensor_1`)
- Automation types include: trigger-based, state-based, time-based, event-based
- Handle both YAML and JSON automation configurations
- Implement relationship caching to avoid re-parsing on every synergy check
