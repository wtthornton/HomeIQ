# Story 28.1: Real-time Health Monitoring Service

## Story Overview
**Story ID**: STORY-28.1  
**Epic**: EPIC-28 (Environment Health Monitoring System)  
**Priority**: High  
**Story Points**: 8  
**Sprint**: Sprint 1  

## User Story
**As a** HA Ingestor user  
**I want** continuous monitoring of my Home Assistant environment health  
**So that** I can be alerted to issues before they impact my system  

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Monitor HA core service status every 60 seconds
- [ ] Check integration health every 5 minutes
- [ ] Monitor device discovery status continuously
- [ ] Track performance metrics (response time, memory usage)
- [ ] Store health history for trend analysis
- [ ] Send alerts for critical health issues
- [ ] Provide health trend visualization

## Technical Requirements
- Create health monitoring service
- Implement scheduled health checks
- Add performance metrics collection
- Create health history storage
- Implement alerting system
- Design trend visualization
- Add configurable monitoring intervals

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Health monitoring service deployed
- [ ] Scheduled health checks running
- [ ] Performance metrics collected
- [ ] Health history stored
- [ ] Alerting system functional
- [ ] Trend visualization working
- [ ] Monitoring intervals configurable
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing
- [ ] Integration tests completed

## Dependencies
- Environment health dashboard
- HA Ingestor core services
- Notification system

## Risks
- **Risk**: Monitoring overhead impacting HA performance
  - **Mitigation**: Lightweight checks with configurable intervals
- **Risk**: False positive alerts
  - **Mitigation**: Alert threshold tuning and user feedback
