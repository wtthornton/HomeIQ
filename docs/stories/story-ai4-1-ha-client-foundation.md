# Story AI4.1: HA Client Foundation

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story

**As a** system administrator,  
**I want** the AI automation service to securely connect to Home Assistant,  
**so that** it can retrieve existing automation configurations for intelligent filtering

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **AC1: Secure Authentication**
   - Given a configured HA instance with long-lived access token
   - When the HA client initializes
   - Then it should authenticate successfully using the token
   - And handle authentication failures gracefully

2. **AC2: API Connectivity**
   - Given an authenticated HA client
   - When testing connection health
   - Then it should successfully ping HA API endpoints
   - And return connection status and HA version information

3. **AC3: Error Handling**
   - Given various failure scenarios (network issues, invalid token, HA down)
   - When the HA client attempts to connect
   - Then it should handle errors gracefully without crashing
   - And provide meaningful error messages for debugging

4. **AC4: Configuration Management**
   - Given HA connection parameters
   - When the service starts
   - Then it should load configuration from environment variables
   - And validate required parameters are present

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Task 3: Error Handling & Logging (AC: 3)
  - [x] Implement comprehensive error handling
  - [x] Add structured logging for HA client operations
  - [x] Create fallback mechanisms for connection failures
  - [x] Add retry logic with exponential backoff

- [x] Task 4: Testing & Documentation (AC: 1, 2, 3, 4)
  - [x] Write unit tests for HA client class
  - [x] Create integration tests with mock HA instance
  - [x] Update service documentation
  - [x] Add configuration examples

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
Based on `docs/architecture/source-tree.md`:
- HA client should be implemented in `services/ai-automation-service/src/`
- Follow existing patterns in `services/ai-automation-service/src/` for client classes
- Use shared logging configuration from `shared/logging_config.py`

### Technology Stack
From `docs/architecture/tech-stack.md`:
- **Backend Framework**: FastAPI with async/await patterns
- **HTTP Client**: Use aiohttp for async HTTP requests to HA
- **Authentication**: Long-lived access tokens (HA standard)
- **Configuration**: Environment variables with validation
- **Logging**: Structured logging with correlation IDs

### Coding Standards
From `docs/architecture/coding-standards.md`:
- Use snake_case for Python functions and variables
- Implement proper type hints (PEP 484)
- Write docstrings for all public methods (Google style)
- Handle exceptions explicitly, avoid bare except clauses
- Use async/await patterns for HTTP operations

### Testing Standards
- **Test Location**: `services/ai-automation-service/tests/`
- **Test Framework**: pytest with async support
- **Test Coverage**: Aim for 90%+ coverage
- **Mock Strategy**: Mock aiohttp responses for HA API calls
- **Integration Tests**: Test with actual HA instance in test environment

### Implementation Notes
- HA REST API endpoint: `http://192.168.1.86:8123/api/`
- Authentication header: `Authorization: Bearer {token}`
- Health check endpoint: `/api/`
- Version endpoint: `/api/config`
- Implement connection pooling for efficiency
- Add request timeouts to prevent hanging connections

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used
Claude Sonnet 4.5 (Dev Agent - James)

### Debug Log References
- Test execution log: All 14 tests passed successfully
- Context7 documentation consulted for aiohttp and aiohttp_retry best practices

### Completion Notes List
1. ✅ Enhanced existing `HomeAssistantClient` with Context7 best practices
2. ✅ Implemented connection pooling with TCPConnector (20 connections, 5 per host)
3. ✅ Added exponential backoff retry logic (3 retries, 1s initial delay)
4. ✅ Implemented version detection via `/api/config` endpoint
5. ✅ Added comprehensive health check with status information
6. ✅ Created `_get_session()` for session reuse and connection pooling
7. ✅ Implemented `close()` method with SSL grace period (250ms)
8. ✅ Added configuration parameters: `ha_max_retries`, `ha_retry_delay`, `ha_timeout`
9. ✅ Updated environment file with new HA client configuration
10. ✅ Created comprehensive test suite with 14 test cases (all passing)
11. ✅ Tests cover: authentication, connection pooling, retry logic, error handling, health checks

### File List
**Modified Files:**
- `services/ai-automation-service/src/clients/ha_client.py` - Enhanced HA client with retry logic, connection pooling, and health checks
- `services/ai-automation-service/src/config.py` - Added HA retry/timeout configuration parameters
- `infrastructure/env.ai-automation` - Added HA_MAX_RETRIES, HA_RETRY_DELAY, HA_TIMEOUT

**Created Files:**
- `services/ai-automation-service/tests/test_ha_client.py` - Comprehensive unit tests for HA client (14 tests, all passing)
