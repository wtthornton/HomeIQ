## Story

As a dashboard user,  
I want delightful micro-animations and smooth transitions throughout the dashboard,  
So that the interface feels premium, responsive, and alive with feedback.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] All transitions smooth (60fps)
- [x] Animations feel natural (easing curves)
- [x] No janky animations
- [x] Reduced motion support (prefers-reduced-motion)
- [x] Performance optimized (will-change, transform)
- [x] Consistent animation durations
- [x] Dark mode animations working
- [x] All components have hover effects
- [x] Button press feedback working
- [x] Status changes animate smoothly
- [x] Number counting effect on metrics
- [x] Pulse effect on all live data indicators
- [ ] 60fps animations verified on hardware (pending user testing)

---

## Tasks

### Task 1: Animation Framework Setup
- [x] Validate animations.css structure (280 lines)
- [x] Ensure GPU acceleration (transform, opacity, will-change)
- [x] Verify prefers-reduced-motion support
- [x] Test dark mode color transitions

### Task 2: Card Component Animations
- [x] **MetricCard**: Number counting, live pulse, card hover
- [x] **ServiceCard**: Status badges, live pulse dot, button animations
- [x] **ChartCard**: Hover effects, tooltip fade-in
- [x] **DataSourceCard**: Number counting, status badges, live pulse
- [x] **LiveGameCard**: Live pulse, score animations
- [x] **UpcomingGameCard**: Countdown updates
- [x] **CompletedGameCard**: Result highlighting

### Task 3: List Stagger Animations
- [x] ServicesTab - Core Services grid stagger
- [x] ServicesTab - External Services grid stagger
- [x] Configurable delay (0.05s per item)
- [x] Smooth cascade effect

### Task 4: Live Pulse Indicators
- [x] MetricCard - 3 live metrics (Total Events, Events/min, API Calls)
- [x] ServiceCard - Running services with pulse dot
- [x] DataSourceCard - Healthy sources with pulse
- [x] Visual feedback for real-time data

### Task 5: Button & Interaction Animations
- [x] Button press animations (.btn-press)
- [x] Button hover states (.btn-primary, .btn-secondary)
- [x] Icon entrance animations (.icon-entrance)
- [x] Status transition animations (.status-transition)

### Task 6: Performance Optimization
- [x] GPU-accelerated properties only (transform, opacity)
- [x] will-change hints
- [x] backface-visibility: hidden
- [x] RequestAnimationFrame for number counting
- [ ] 60fps validation on actual hardware (pending)

## Animation Classes Applied

```css
/* Card Animations */
.card-base                  /* Base card styles with shadow */
.card-hover                 /* Lift effect on hover (-4px translate) */
.content-fade-in            /* Fade-in animation (300ms) */

/* Status & Badges */
.badge-base                 /* Badge base styles */
.badge-success/warning/error/info  /* Status badge variants */
.status-transition          /* Smooth status color transitions */

/* Interactive Elements */
.btn-press                  /* Button press animation (scale 0.98) */
.btn-primary/secondary      /* Button styles with transitions */
.icon-entrance              /* Icon pop-in animation */

/* Live Data Indicators */
.live-pulse                 /* Pulse animation for live cards */
.live-pulse-dot             /* Pulse dot indicator */
.number-counter             /* Number counting transition */

/* List Animations */
.stagger-in-list            /* Parent container for stagger */
/* Individual items use animationDelay inline style */
```
