# Story AI2.3: Device Matching & Feature Analysis

**Epic:** Epic-AI-2 - Device Intelligence System  
**Story ID:** AI2.3  
**Priority:** High  
**Estimated Effort:** 10-12 hours  
**Dependencies:** 
- Story AI2.1 ✅ Complete (MQTT Capability Listener)
- Story AI2.2 ✅ Complete (Database Schema)
- Data API running (devices endpoint)

**Related Documents:**
- PRD v2.0: `docs/prd.md` (Story 2.3, FR14, NFR14)
- Architecture: `docs/architecture-device-intelligence.md` (Section 5.3)

## User Story

**As a** Home Assistant user  
**I want** the system to analyze my device utilization  
**so that** I can see which device features I'm using vs. which are available but unused

---

## Business Value

- **Utilization Visibility:** See what % of each device's capabilities are configured
- **Opportunity Discovery:** Identify unused features worth exploring
- **Multi-Device Analysis:** Analyze entire home at once (99 devices)
- **Manufacturer Insights:** Compare utilization across brands
- **Foundation for Suggestions:** Enables Story 2.4 (feature-based suggestions)

**Key Metric:** Calculate device utilization = (configured features / total features) × 100

---

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements (from PRD)

1. ✅ **FR14:** Match device instances to capability definitions by model
2. ✅ **FR14:** Query devices from data-api service
3. ✅ **FR14:** Look up capabilities from device_capabilities table
4. ✅ **FR14:** Calculate utilization score per device (configured/total)
5. ✅ **FR14:** Calculate overall utilization across all devices
6. ✅ **FR14:** Identify unused features per device
7. ✅ **FR14:** Rank opportunities by impact and complexity
8. ✅ **FR14:** Support manufacturer-level utilization breakdown

### Non-Functional Requirements (from PRD)

9. ✅ **NFR14:** Analyze 100 devices in <30 seconds
10. ✅ **NFR14:** Memory efficient (stream processing for large device lists)
11. ✅ **NFR14:** Graceful handling when capabilities not found
12. ✅ **Testing:** 80%+ test coverage for analysis logic
13. ✅ **Integration:** Works with Stories 2.1 and 2.2

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Architecture Overview

**From Architecture Document Section 5.3:**

This story implements:
1. **FeatureAnalyzer** - Analyzes devices to identify unused features
2. **Device Matching Logic** - Links device instances to capability definitions
3. **Utilization Calculator** - Computes usage percentages
4. **Opportunity Ranker** - Prioritizes unused features by impact

---

### Component: FeatureAnalyzer

**File:** `services/ai-automation-service/src/device_intelligence/feature_analyzer.py` (NEW)

**Purpose:** Analyze device instances to identify unused features and calculate utilization

**Key Responsibilities:**
1. Query devices from data-api
2. Match devices to capabilities by model
3. Determine which features are configured (HA entity attributes)
4. Calculate utilization scores
5. Identify and rank unused features

**Implementation Pattern (from Architecture Section 5.3):**

```python
# services/ai-automation-service/src/device_intelligence/feature_analyzer.py

from typing import List, Dict, Optional
from datetime import datetime

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

## Status

**Current Status:** Ready for Review  
**Implementation Date:** 2025-10-16  
**Developer:** James (AI Agent)  
**Next Step:** Story 2.4 (Feature Suggestion Generator)  
**Blocked By:** None  
**Blocking:** Story 2.4 (Feature Suggestion Generator)

## Notes

### Simplified Feature Detection

**Story 2.3 Scope:**
- Simplified feature detection (basic entity type checking)
- Assumes only core features configured (light, switch, climate)
- Advanced features marked as unconfigured

**Story 2.4 Enhancement:**
- Full HA entity attribute analysis
- Check automation triggers for feature usage
- Historical data analysis for feature configuration

This progressive approach allows Story 2.3 to deliver value quickly while Story 2.4 adds sophistication.

### Data API Integration

**Required Endpoint:**
```
GET /api/devices
Response: { "devices": [ { "device_id", "name", "model", "entity_id", ... } ] }
```

**Story 2.3 will call this endpoint to get device list.**

### Performance Expectations

- 100 devices analyzed in <30 seconds
- Database queries: <10ms per device
- Overall analysis: <500ms overhead
- Memory: Stream processing, <100MB
