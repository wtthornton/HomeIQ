# Story 32.1: High-Complexity React Component Refactoring

## Status
**Done** ✅ - Both AnalyticsPanel and AlertsPanel Refactored

## Story
**As a** developer maintaining the health dashboard,  
**I want** to refactor high-complexity React components (AnalyticsPanel and AlertsPanel),  
**so that** the codebase is more maintainable, testable, and easier to understand and modify.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **AnalyticsPanel Refactored**
   - Cyclomatic complexity reduced from 54 to ≤15
   - Component broken into smaller, focused sub-components
   - Data fetching logic extracted into custom hooks
   - All existing functionality preserved
   - All Vitest tests pass without modification

2. **AlertsPanel Refactored**
   - Cyclomatic complexity reduced from 44 to ≤15
   - Component broken into smaller, focused sub-components
   - Alert management logic extracted appropriately
   - All existing functionality preserved
   - All Vitest tests pass without modification

3. **Code Quality Metrics**
   - ESLint complexity warnings eliminated for both components
   - No increase in bundle size (may decrease)
   - React DevTools Profiler shows no performance regression
   - Components follow React best practices (hooks, composition)

4. **Testing & Verification**
   - All existing Vitest unit tests pass
   - All Playwright E2E tests pass
   - Manual QA confirms UI behavior unchanged
   - No console errors or warnings

5. **Documentation**
   - Component structure documented in code comments
   - Custom hooks have JSDoc comments
   - README updated if component architecture significantly changed

## Dev Notes

### Project Context (Loaded from Architecture Docs)

**Source Tree Location:**
- Components: `services/health-dashboard/src/components/`
- Target files:
  - `services/health-dashboard/src/components/AnalyticsPanel.tsx`
  - `services/health-dashboard/src/components/AlertsPanel.tsx`
- Hooks: `services/health-dashboard/src/hooks/`
- Types: `services/health-dashboard/src/types/`

**Technology Stack:**
- React 18.2.0 with hooks
- TypeScript 5.2.2 (strict mode)
- Vite 5.0.8 (build tool)
- TailwindCSS 3.4.0 (styling)
- Chart.js 4.5.0 (charts in AnalyticsPanel)
- Vitest 3.2.4 (unit testing)
- Playwright 1.56.0 (E2E testing)

**Existing Patterns to Follow:**
- Custom hooks for data fetching (see `useHealth.ts`, `useRealtimeMetrics.ts`)
- Component composition over inheritance
- TypeScript interfaces in `types/` directory
- API service layer in `services/api.ts`

**Current Complexity Metrics (Before Refactoring):**
```
AnalyticsPanel.tsx:
- Complexity: 54 (Line 59)
- Lines: 351
- Issues: Arrow function too long, complexity too high

AlertsPanel.tsx:
- Complexity: 44 (Line 17)
- Lines: 390
- Issues: Arrow function too long, complexity too high, nested ternaries
- Additional: Complexity 22 at line 266
```

**Integration Points:**
- API Service: `services/api.ts` - do not modify
- WebSocket Service: `services/websocket.ts` - do not modify
- Types: `types/api.ts` - may extend if needed
- Parent Component: `Dashboard.tsx` - should not require changes

**Coding Standards:**
- Use PascalCase for components
- Use camelCase for hooks (prefixed with `use`)
- Explicit return types on all functions
- No `any` types (use proper TypeScript types)
- Component props defined as TypeScript interfaces
- Max complexity: 15 per function
- Max lines per function: 100

### Refactoring Strategy

**Custom Hook Pattern:**
```typescript
// Example: useAnalyticsData.ts
export const useAnalyticsData = (timeRange: string) => {
  const [data, setData] = useState<AnalyticsData | null>(null);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
  const [error, setError] = useState<Error | null>(null);

  const fetchData = useCallback(async () => {
    // ... fetch logic
  }, [timeRange]);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetchData();
  }, [fetchData]);

  return { data, loading, error, refetch: fetchData };
};
```

**Sub-Component Pattern:**
```typescript
// Example: AnalyticsSummaryCard.tsx
interface AnalyticsSummaryCardProps {
  title: string;
  value: number | string;
  trend?: number;
  loading?: boolean;
}

export const AnalyticsSummaryCard: React.FC<AnalyticsSummaryCardProps> = ({
  title,
  value,
  trend,
  loading = false
}) => {
  // ... component logic
};
```

**Complexity Reduction Techniques:**
1. **Extract logic into hooks** - Move data fetching, state management
2. **Create sub-components** - Break UI into smaller pieces
3. **Replace nested ternaries** - Use early returns or separate components
4. **Simplify conditionals** - Extract condition checks into named variables
5. **Use composition** - Combine small components rather than one large one

### Testing

**Test File Locations:**
- `services/health-dashboard/tests/components/AnalyticsPanel.test.tsx` (if exists)
- `services/health-dashboard/tests/components/AlertsPanel.test.tsx` (if exists)
- `tests/e2e/health-dashboard.spec.ts` (E2E tests)

**Testing Standards:**
- Use Vitest for unit/component tests
- Use Testing Library React for component testing
- Use Playwright for E2E tests
- All tests must pass before story completion
- Coverage should not decrease

**Testing Frameworks:**
- **Vitest** - Unit testing (Jest-compatible)
- **@testing-library/react** - Component testing utilities
- **Playwright** - E2E browser testing
- **Happy-DOM** - Lightweight DOM for tests

**Test Commands:**
```bash
cd services/health-dashboard

# Unit tests (specific component)
npm run test -- AnalyticsPanel
npm run test -- AlertsPanel

# All unit tests
npm run test

# E2E tests
npm run test:e2e

# Coverage report
npm run test:coverage
```

**Test Requirements:**
1. All existing tests must pass without modification
2. If adding new sub-components, consider adding tests
3. E2E tests verify no UI regressions
4. Manual testing required for complex interactions
