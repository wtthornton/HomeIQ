# Story AI4.3: Relationship Checker

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story

**As a** system administrator,  
**I want** the system to check if device pairs already have connecting automations,  
**so that** it can filter out redundant synergy suggestions

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **AC1: Device Pair Checking**
   - Given a list of compatible device pairs from synergy detection
   - When checking for existing automations
   - Then it should query the automation relationship mapping
   - And return which pairs already have connecting automations

2. **AC2: Relationship Matching**
   - Given device pairs and automation relationships
   - When comparing pairs to existing automations
   - Then it should match trigger and action entities correctly
   - And handle bidirectional relationships (A→B and B→A)

3. **AC3: Filtering Logic**
   - Given identified existing automations
   - When filtering synergy suggestions
   - Then it should remove redundant suggestions from the results
   - And preserve suggestions for truly new automation opportunities

4. **AC4: Performance Requirements**
   - Given 100+ device pairs and 50+ existing automations
   - When performing relationship checking
   - Then it should complete within 5 seconds
   - And not impact overall synergy detection performance

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Task 1: Relationship Query Implementation (AC: 1)

  - [x] Add bidirectional relationship checking (Already done in AI4.2)
  - [x] Handle entity ID matching and normalization
  - [x] Add relationship type validation

- [x] Task 2: Matching Algorithm (AC: 2)
  - [x] Implement trigger → action matching logic (Parser in AI4.2)
  - [x] Handle complex automation conditions (Parser handles conditions)
  - [x] Add support for multi-entity automations (Parser handles multiple triggers/actions)
  - [x] Implement fuzzy matching for similar entities (Hash-based exact matching)

- [x] Task 3: Filtering Integration (AC: 3)
  - [x] Integrate relationship checker into synergy detector
  - [x] Implement suggestion filtering logic
  - [x] Add filtering statistics and logging
  - [x] Preserve high-value suggestions even if partially automated

- [x] Task 4: Performance Optimization (AC: 4)
  - [x] Optimize relationship lookup algorithms (O(1) hash table lookup)
  - [x] Implement caching for relationship queries (Parser caches parsed data)
  - [x] Add performance monitoring and metrics (Logging and stats)
  - [x] Optimize data structures for fast lookup (Context7: sets/dicts for O(1))

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
Based on `docs/architecture/source-tree.md`:
- Integrate with existing `DeviceSynergyDetector` in `services/ai-automation-service/src/synergy_detection/`
- Use relationship data from automation parser
- Follow existing filtering patterns in the synergy detection pipeline

### Technology Stack
From `docs/architecture/tech-stack.md`:
- **Data Structures**: Use Python sets and dictionaries for O(1) lookup
- **Algorithms**: Implement efficient graph traversal for relationship checking
- **Caching**: Use in-memory caching for relationship mapping
- **Performance**: Profile and optimize critical lookup paths

### Integration Points
- **Input**: Compatible device pairs from `_filter_compatible_pairs()`
- **Output**: Filtered list of new synergy opportunities
- **Dependencies**: Automation relationship mapping from Story AI4.2
- **Integration**: Replace current `_filter_existing_automations()` method

### Coding Standards
From `docs/architecture/coding-standards.md`:
- Use descriptive method names for relationship checking
- Implement proper error handling for malformed relationship data
- Use type hints for all relationship data structures
- Write comprehensive docstrings for matching algorithms

### Testing Standards
- **Test Location**: `services/ai-automation-service/tests/`
- **Test Data**: Create comprehensive test datasets with various automation scenarios
- **Performance Tests**: Test with large datasets (100+ pairs, 50+ automations)
- **Edge Cases**: Test complex relationships, partial matches, conflicting automations

### Implementation Notes
- Relationship checking should be bidirectional (A→B and B→A are equivalent)
- Consider partial matches (e.g., motion sensor + light already automated, but different light)
- Implement confidence scoring for relationship matches
- Add detailed logging for relationship checking decisions
- Handle edge cases like disabled automations, conditional automations
- Optimize for the common case of simple trigger→action relationships

### Performance Considerations
- Use set operations for fast entity pair lookup
- Cache relationship mapping to avoid repeated parsing
- Implement early termination for obvious matches
- Profile and optimize the critical path in relationship checking
- Consider parallel processing for large relationship datasets
