# Story 9.2: Enhanced Testing Coverage

## Story Overview
**Story ID**: 9.2  
**Story Title**: Enhanced Testing Coverage  
**Story Type**: Enhancement  
**Story Priority**: P2 - MEDIUM  
**Story Effort**: 1-2 days  
**Story Status**: Draft  
**Story Epic**: Epic 9 - Optimization & Testing  

## Story Description
**As a** system administrator,  
**I want** comprehensive test coverage of 95% or higher,  
**so that** the system is thoroughly tested and reliable.

## Business Justification
High test coverage is essential for system reliability and confidence in production deployments.

## User Story
**As a** system administrator,  
**I want** comprehensive test coverage across all system components,  
**so that** I can be confident in system reliability and stability.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **AC1: Test Coverage Analysis** - Current test coverage analyzed and gaps identified
2. **AC2: Test Implementation** - Missing tests implemented to achieve 95%+ coverage
3. **AC3: Test Quality Validation** - Test quality validated and improved
4. **AC4: Test Automation** - Test automation and CI/CD integration enhanced
5. **AC5: Test Documentation** - Test coverage and procedures documented
