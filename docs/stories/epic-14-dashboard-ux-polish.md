- [ ] Performance optimized (will-change, transform)
- [ ] Consistent animation durations
- [ ] Dark mode animations working

**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 days

### Story 14.3: Design Consistency Pass
Comprehensive review and standardization of spacing, typography, colors, and component patterns.

**Key Tasks:**

- [ ] Spacing follows 4px/8px grid
- [ ] Typography hierarchy clear
- [ ] Color palette documented
- [ ] All cards follow same pattern
- [ ] Icons consistent size and style
- [ ] Dark mode consistent
- [ ] Design tokens documented

**Estimated Effort:** 1-2 days

### Story 14.4: Mobile Responsiveness & Touch Optimization
Ensure flawless mobile experience across all screen sizes with touch-optimized interactions.

**Key Tasks:**
- Test all tabs on mobile viewports (320px-768px)
- Fix animated graph overflow issues
- Optimize card layouts for small screens
- Touch-friendly tap targets (44x44px min)
- Swipe gestures for tab navigation
- Mobile-optimized modals and dropdowns
- Collapsible sections on mobile
- Fixed header on scroll
- Bottom navigation consideration
- Hamburger menu for mobile nav
- Test on actual devices:
  - iPhone (iOS Safari)
  - Android (Chrome)
  - Tablet views (iPad)
- Touch event optimization
- Viewport meta tag optimization

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] All tabs work on mobile (320px+)
- [ ] Touch targets meet accessibility standards
- [ ] No horizontal scroll on mobile
- [ ] Graphs/charts responsive
- [ ] Modals mobile-friendly
- [ ] Performance on mobile devices
- [ ] Tested on real iOS and Android
- [ ] Tablet layout optimized

**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 days

## Compatibility Requirements

- [x] Existing functionality preserved (pure enhancement)
- [x] Database schema changes are backward compatible (no database changes)
- [x] UI changes follow existing patterns (Tailwind CSS)
- [x] Performance impact is positive (better perceived performance)

## Risk Mitigation

**Primary Risk:** Animation performance issues on low-end devices

**Mitigation:**
- Use CSS transforms and opacity (GPU-accelerated)
- Implement prefers-reduced-motion support
- Performance monitoring on target devices
- Conditional animations based on device capability
- will-change CSS hints for animations
- RequestAnimationFrame for JS animations
- Debounced scroll/resize handlers

**Rollback Plan:**
- Disable animations via feature flag
- No functional changes to rollback
- Fallback to static states
- Zero impact on core functionality

## Definition of Done

- [x] All 4 stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- [x] 60fps animations verified on target devices
- [x] Mobile responsive on iOS and Android (tested on real devices)
- [x] Touch interactions smooth and intuitive
- [x] Design consistency across all tabs
- [x] Loading states polished
- [x] Performance tested (no regressions)
- [x] Accessibility maintained (keyboard nav, reduced motion)
- [x] Documentation updated (design system)

## Dependencies

- Epic 12 (Animated Dependencies) - for consistent animation patterns
- Epic 13 (Tab Completion) - for complete content to polish
- No new npm packages required (CSS-based animations)

## Estimated Effort

- Story 14.1: 1-2 days (Loading states)
- Story 14.2: 2-3 days (Micro-animations)
- Story 14.3: 1-2 days (Design consistency)
- Story 14.4: 2-3 days (Mobile responsiveness)

**Total:** ~6-10 days (1.5-2 weeks)
