gate_decision_rationale: "Story 2.1 demonstrates excellent implementation quality with comprehensive data normalization capabilities. The robust validation system with malformed event detection, efficient batch processing (InfluxDB integration), and proper error handling effectively addresses all identified risks. The medium risk of data corruption (Score: 4) has been comprehensively mitigated through multi-stage validation, malformed event detection, and graceful failure handling. All acceptance criteria are met with essential unit test coverage (41/41 tests passing) and production-ready normalization pipeline."
