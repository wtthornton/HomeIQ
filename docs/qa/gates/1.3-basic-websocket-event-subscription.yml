gate_decision_rationale: "Story 1.3 demonstrates exceptional implementation quality with comprehensive event processing capabilities. The high-performance architecture with async processing (10 concurrent workers, 1000 events/second), robust error handling (categorized with severity levels), and advanced connection management (exponential backoff with jitter) effectively addresses all identified risks. The medium risk of event processing overload (Score: 4) has been comprehensively mitigated through sophisticated async processing, rate limiting, and overflow handling. All acceptance criteria are met with complete unit test coverage (35/35 tests passing) and production-ready event subscription system."
