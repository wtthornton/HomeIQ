## Notes
- This gate validates the complete Context7 KB cache integration
- Tests should be run in order of phases (1-4)
- Performance benchmarks should be established before testing
- User acceptance testing should be conducted after technical validation
- KB integration should be monitored for performance and usability after deployment
