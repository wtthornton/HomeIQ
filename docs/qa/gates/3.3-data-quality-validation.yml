status_reason: "Story 3.3 has excellent documentation and requirements but critical implementation gap. The comprehensive data quality validation system is not implemented in the codebase, creating high risks for data quality blindness, quality alerting gaps, and lack of quality visibility. While the foundation exists in basic validation and health monitoring, the complete quality monitoring framework needs implementation."
