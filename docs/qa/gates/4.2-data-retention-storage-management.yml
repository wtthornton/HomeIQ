status_reason: "Story 4.2 has excellent documentation and requirements but critical implementation gap. The data retention and storage management system is not implemented in the codebase, creating critical risks for data loss, storage capacity issues, and storage monitoring blindness. While the foundation exists in InfluxDB storage, the complete storage management framework needs implementation."
