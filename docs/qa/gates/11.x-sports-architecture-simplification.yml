  title: NHL Data Routing Fix & Architecture Simplification
  status: IN_PROGRESS
  created: 2025-10-12
  validator: bmad-master
  priority: CRITICAL
  type: HOTFIX

## Issue Summary
**Bug**: NHL data not working in production due to missing nginx routing configuration
**Impact**: Users unable to access Sports tab NHL data
**Root Cause**: Two competing services (sports-api vs sports-data), missing production routing
**Solution**: Simplified to single service (sports-data) with corrected nginx routing

## Phase 1: Critical Fix Validation

## Known Issues

### Non-Critical Issues
1. **sports-data health check false positive**
   - Status: Known issue
   - Impact: Docker shows unhealthy but service works perfectly
   - Priority: P3 (cosmetic only)
   - Fix: Update health check command in docker-compose.yml
   - Workaround: Service is fully functional, ignore Docker health status

2. **Hardcoded team lists**
   - Status: Technical debt
   - Impact: Team list incomplete (stubs only)
   - Priority: P2 (enhancement)
   - Fix: Fetch complete team lists from API
   - Workaround: Manual team ID entry works

3. **admin-api unhealthy**
   - Status: Pre-existing issue (not related to this fix)
   - Impact: Some admin features may be degraded
   - Priority: P2 (separate ticket needed)
   - Fix: Investigate admin-api health check separately

git checkout HEAD~1 services/health-dashboard/nginx.conf
docker-compose build health-dashboard
docker-compose up -d health-dashboard

# Rollback Step 2: If needed, restore sports-api
# Uncomment lines 398-442 in docker-compose.yml
# Add API_SPORTS_KEY to environment
docker-compose up -d sports-api

# Rollback Step 3: Verify system working
curl http://localhost:8005/health
curl http://localhost:3000/health
```

**Rollback Time**: 5 minutes  
**Rollback Risk**: Very Low  
**Data Loss Risk**: None
