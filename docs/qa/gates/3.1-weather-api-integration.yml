gate_decision_rationale: "Story 3.1 demonstrates excellent implementation quality with comprehensive weather API integration capabilities. The robust error handling with cached data fallback, intelligent rate limiting (configurable request intervals and quota management), and efficient async operations effectively addresses all identified risks. The medium risk of weather API dependency (Score: 4) has been comprehensively mitigated through comprehensive error handling with fallback to cached data, rate limiting, and graceful degradation. All acceptance criteria are met with essential unit test coverage (38/38 tests passing) and production-ready weather enrichment system."
