## Low Complexity Validation

### Functional Tests
- [ ] **Test 1.1**: Architect agent mentions Context7 when making technology decisions
- [ ] **Test 1.2**: Dev agent mentions Context7 when implementing with external libraries
- [ ] **Test 1.3**: QA agent mentions Context7 when assessing library risks
- [ ] **Test 1.4**: Architecture template suggests Context7 usage
- [ ] **Test 1.5**: PRD template suggests Context7 usage
- [ ] **Test 1.6**: Story template suggests Context7 usage

### Non-Functional Tests

- [ ] **Test 2.6**: Error handling works for invalid inputs

### Non-Functional Tests
- [ ] **Test 2.7**: No existing BMad functionality is broken
- [ ] **Test 2.8**: Command execution times are acceptable
- [ ] **Test 2.9**: YAML syntax is valid in all modified files
- [ ] **Test 2.10**: Rollback process works correctly

## Integration Tests
- [ ] **Test 3.1**: Context7 integration works with existing BMad workflows
- [ ] **Test 3.2**: Context7 integration doesn't interfere with other MCP tools
- [ ] **Test 3.3**: Context7 integration works across different BMad agents
- [ ] **Test 3.4**: Context7 integration works in different BMad environments

## Performance Tests
- [ ] **Test 4.1**: Context7 commands execute within acceptable time limits
- [ ] **Test 4.2**: Context7 integration doesn't significantly impact BMad startup time
- [ ] **Test 4.3**: Context7 integration doesn't cause memory leaks
- [ ] **Test 4.4**: Context7 integration doesn't cause token bloat

## Security Tests
- [ ] **Test 5.1**: Context7 integration doesn't expose sensitive information
- [ ] **Test 5.2**: Context7 integration doesn't allow unauthorized access
- [ ] **Test 5.3**: Context7 integration doesn't introduce security vulnerabilities
- [ ] **Test 5.4**: Context7 integration follows BMad security best practices

## Usability Tests
- [ ] **Test 6.1**: Context7 commands are intuitive and easy to use
- [ ] **Test 6.2**: Context7 error messages are clear and helpful
- [ ] **Test 6.3**: Context7 help documentation is comprehensive
- [ ] **Test 6.4**: Context7 integration enhances user experience

## Gate Decision Criteria

### PASS Criteria
- All functional tests pass
- All non-functional tests pass
- All integration tests pass
- All performance tests pass
- All security tests pass
- All usability tests pass

### CONCERNS Criteria
- Minor issues with non-critical tests
- Performance impact within acceptable limits
- Usability issues that don't block functionality

### FAIL Criteria
- Any functional test fails
- Any security test fails
- Significant performance impact
- Critical usability issues
- Integration tests fail

## Risk Assessment
- **Technical Risk**: Low (minimal system changes)
- **Security Risk**: Low (no sensitive data exposure)
- **Performance Risk**: Low (minimal impact on existing functionality)
- **Usability Risk**: Low (enhances existing workflows)

## Recommendations
- Start with low complexity implementation
- Test thoroughly before moving to medium complexity
- Monitor performance impact during implementation
- Gather user feedback on usability

## Notes
- This gate validates both low and medium complexity implementations
- Tests should be run in order of complexity (low first, then medium)
- Rollback procedures should be tested for both complexity levels
- User acceptance testing should be conducted after technical validation
