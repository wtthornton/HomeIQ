gate: "CONCERNS"
status_reason: "Story 4.1 has excellent documentation and requirements but critical implementation gap. The comprehensive logging and monitoring system is not implemented in the codebase, creating high risks for monitoring blindness, logging gaps, and alerting gaps. While the foundation exists in basic logging and health monitoring, the complete monitoring framework needs implementation."
