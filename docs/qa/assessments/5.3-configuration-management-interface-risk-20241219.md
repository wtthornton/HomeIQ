## Detailed Risk Register

| Risk ID | Description | Probability | Impact | Score | Priority |
|---------|-------------|-------------|---------|-------|----------|
| SEC-001 | Configuration security and access control vulnerabilities | Medium (2) | High (3) | 6 | High |
| DATA-001 | Configuration validation and consistency failures | Medium (2) | High (3) | 6 | High |
| SEC-002 | Configuration data exposure and privacy issues | Low (1) | Medium (2) | 2 | Low |
| DATA-002 | Configuration backup and recovery failures | Low (1) | Medium (2) | 2 | Low |
| PERF-001 | Configuration interface performance under load | Low (1) | Medium (2) | 2 | Low |
| OPS-001 | Configuration change management and versioning | Low (1) | Medium (2) | 2 | Low |
| OPS-002 | Configuration deployment and rollback procedures | Low (1) | Medium (2) | 2 | Low |
| TECH-001 | Configuration interface integration with services | Low (1) | Medium (2) | 2 | Low |

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

*No critical risks requiring immediate testing focus.*

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests

- SEC-001: Configuration security and access control testing
- DATA-001: Configuration validation and consistency testing
- Security vulnerability assessment for configuration management

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests

- Configuration backup and recovery testing
- Configuration interface performance testing
- Configuration change management and versioning testing
- Configuration deployment and rollback testing

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

*No risks require immediate fixes before production deployment.*

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- SEC-001: Implement comprehensive configuration security testing
- DATA-001: Implement robust configuration validation and consistency checks
- SEC-002: Implement configuration data protection and privacy controls

### Accepted Risks

*No risks accepted without mitigation.*

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- Configuration security and access control effectiveness
- Configuration validation and consistency success rates
- Configuration backup and recovery success rates
- Configuration interface performance and usage

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- Configuration security requirements change
- Configuration validation requirements are updated
- Configuration management procedures change
- Security policies are updated
