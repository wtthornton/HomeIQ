- Business: 0 risks
- Operational: 2 risks (1 high)
- Technical: 2 risks (0 high)

### By Component

- API Development: 4 risks
- Security: 2 risks
- Integration: 2 risks

## Detailed Risk Register

| Risk ID | Description | Probability | Impact | Score | Priority |
|---------|-------------|-------------|---------|-------|----------|
| SEC-001 | API authentication and authorization vulnerabilities | Medium (2) | High (3) | 6 | High |
| OPS-001 | API error handling and response consistency | Medium (2) | High (3) | 6 | High |
| SEC-002 | Input validation and injection attack vulnerabilities | Low (1) | Medium (2) | 2 | Low |
| DATA-001 | API data serialization and format consistency | Low (1) | Medium (2) | 2 | Low |
| PERF-001 | API response time and throughput performance | Low (1) | Medium (2) | 2 | Low |
| OPS-002 | API versioning and backward compatibility | Low (1) | Medium (2) | 2 | Low |
| TECH-001 | API integration with existing services | Low (1) | Medium (2) | 2 | Low |
| TECH-002 | API documentation and testing coverage | Low (1) | Medium (2) | 2 | Low |

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

*No critical risks requiring immediate testing focus.*

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests

- SEC-001: API security testing and vulnerability assessment
- OPS-001: API error handling and response consistency testing
- Authentication and authorization mechanism testing

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests

- Input validation and injection attack testing
- API performance and throughput testing
- API versioning and compatibility testing
- API integration and documentation testing

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

*No risks require immediate fixes before production deployment.*

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- SEC-001: Implement comprehensive API security testing and validation
- OPS-001: Implement robust API error handling and response consistency
- SEC-002: Implement comprehensive input validation and security testing

### Accepted Risks

*No risks accepted without mitigation.*

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- API security and vulnerability monitoring
- API error rates and response consistency
- API performance and throughput metrics
- API usage and integration health

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- API security requirements change
- API functionality or endpoints are modified
- Integration requirements are updated
- Performance requirements change
