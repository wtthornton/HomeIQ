- Business: 1 risk (1 high)
- Operational: 2 risks (0 high)
- Technical: 1 risk (0 high)

### By Component

- Weather API: 4 risks
- Caching System: 2 risks
- Integration: 2 risks

## Detailed Risk Register

| Risk ID | Description | Probability | Impact | Score | Priority |
|---------|-------------|-------------|---------|-------|----------|
| BUS-001 | API quota exhaustion causing service degradation | Medium (2) | High (3) | 6 | High |
| PERF-001 | API rate limiting causing processing delays | Medium (2) | High (3) | 6 | High |
| SEC-001 | API key exposure in logs or error messages | Low (1) | Medium (2) | 2 | Low |
| DATA-001 | Stale weather data due to cache failures | Medium (2) | Medium (2) | 4 | Medium |
| PERF-002 | Cache memory usage growth over time | Low (1) | Medium (2) | 2 | Low |
| OPS-001 | API service unavailability handling | Medium (2) | Medium (2) | 4 | Medium |
| OPS-002 | Weather data quality validation | Low (1) | Medium (2) | 2 | Low |
| TECH-001 | API response parsing errors | Low (1) | Medium (2) | 2 | Low |

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

*No critical risks requiring immediate testing focus.*

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests

- BUS-001: API quota management and exhaustion testing
- PERF-001: Rate limiting and throttling mechanism testing
- API failure simulation and recovery testing

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests

- Cache functionality and TTL testing
- API response parsing and validation testing
- Weather data quality and freshness validation
- Memory usage monitoring during extended operation

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

*No risks require immediate fixes before production deployment.*

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- BUS-001: Implement comprehensive API quota monitoring and management
- PERF-001: Add robust rate limiting and request queuing
- DATA-001: Implement cache validation and fallback mechanisms
- OPS-001: Add comprehensive API failure handling

### Accepted Risks

*No risks accepted without mitigation.*

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- API quota usage and remaining limits
- Rate limiting effectiveness and request queuing
- Cache hit rates and data freshness
- API availability and response times

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- API quota limits change
- Weather data requirements change
- Cache performance requirements are updated
- API service availability requirements change
