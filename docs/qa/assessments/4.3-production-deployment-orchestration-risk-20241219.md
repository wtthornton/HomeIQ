Date: 2024-12-19
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 10
- Critical Risks: 1
- High Risks: 3
- Risk Score: 54/100 (calculated)

## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. OPS-001: Deployment Failure Risk

**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High - Complex deployment orchestration with multiple failure points
**Impact**: High - Production outage and service unavailability
**Mitigation**:

- Implement comprehensive deployment testing and validation
- Add rollback mechanisms and failure recovery procedures
- Create deployment monitoring and health checks
**Testing Focus**: Deployment failure simulation and recovery testing, rollback procedure validation

### 2. TECH-001: Configuration Management Failures

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium - Configuration errors in production environment
**Impact**: High - Service misconfiguration and security vulnerabilities
**Mitigation**:

- Implement configuration validation and testing
- Add configuration versioning and change management
- Create configuration backup and recovery procedures

| SEC-001 | Security configuration and access control failures | Low (1) | Medium (2) | 2 | Low |
| TECH-002 | Infrastructure compatibility and migration issues | Low (1) | Medium (2) | 2 | Low |

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

- OPS-001: Deployment failure simulation and recovery testing
- Rollback procedure validation and testing
- Production deployment testing in staging environment

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests

- TECH-001: Configuration validation and testing
- OPS-002: Service orchestration and dependency testing
- BUS-001: Downtime impact assessment and testing

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests

- Health check and monitoring setup validation
- Resource provisioning and scaling testing
- Backup and disaster recovery procedure testing

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- OPS-001: Deployment failure protection must be implemented and tested

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- TECH-001: Configuration management and validation must be implemented
- OPS-002: Service orchestration and dependency management must be robust
- BUS-001: Downtime impact must be minimized with proper procedures

### Accepted Risks

*No risks accepted without mitigation.*

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- Deployment success rates and failure patterns
- Configuration validation and compliance
- Service orchestration and dependency health
- Production performance and availability

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- Deployment procedures change
- Configuration requirements are updated
- Service dependencies change
- Production requirements are modified
