## Detailed Risk Register

| Risk ID | Description | Probability | Impact | Score | Priority |
|---------|-------------|-------------|---------|-------|----------|
| DATA-001 | Data corruption during normalization process | Medium (2) | High (3) | 6 | High |
| PERF-001 | Normalization bottleneck under high event volume | Medium (2) | High (3) | 6 | High |
| DATA-002 | Unit conversion errors leading to incorrect data | Medium (2) | Medium (2) | 4 | Medium |
| DATA-003 | Timestamp normalization failures | Low (1) | Medium (2) | 2 | Low |
| PERF-002 | Memory usage growth with large batches | Medium (2) | Medium (2) | 4 | Medium |
| OPS-001 | InfluxDB write failures and retry logic | Medium (2) | Medium (2) | 4 | Medium |
| OPS-002 | Normalization error handling and recovery | Low (1) | Medium (2) | 2 | Low |

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

*No critical risks requiring immediate testing focus.*

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests

- DATA-001: Data integrity testing throughout normalization pipeline
- PERF-001: Load testing with high event volumes
- Data corruption detection and prevention tests

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests

- Unit conversion accuracy tests
- Timestamp normalization edge case tests
- Memory usage monitoring during batch processing
- InfluxDB write failure and retry testing

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

*No risks require immediate fixes before production deployment.*

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- DATA-001: Implement comprehensive data validation and integrity checks
- PERF-001: Add batch processing and queue management
- DATA-002: Implement unit conversion validation and testing
- PERF-002: Add memory monitoring and batch size limits

### Accepted Risks

*No risks accepted without mitigation.*

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- Data normalization success rates and error rates
- Processing latency and throughput metrics
- Unit conversion accuracy and validation
- InfluxDB write success rates and retry patterns

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- Data normalization requirements change
- Expected event volumes increase significantly
- Unit conversion standards are updated
- InfluxDB schema or performance requirements change
