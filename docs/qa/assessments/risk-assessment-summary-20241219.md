- Data integrity and consistency testing
- Error handling coverage analysis

### Standard Testing
- Functional testing for all stories
- Integration testing between services
- User experience and interface testing
- Documentation and CLI tool validation

## Monitoring Requirements

### System-Level Monitoring
- Connection stability and reconnection success rates
- System performance under load
- Deployment success rates and rollback effectiveness

### Service-Level Monitoring
- API security and vulnerability monitoring
- Data processing accuracy and consistency
- Error rates and failure patterns

### Business-Level Monitoring

## Conclusion

The risk assessment reveals a well-structured project with manageable risk levels. The three critical risks are concentrated in core infrastructure areas (connection management, performance, and deployment) and can be effectively mitigated with proper planning and testing. The high-risk items are primarily related to performance optimization, data integrity, and security, which are typical concerns for data-intensive systems.

**Recommendation**: Proceed with development while implementing the identified risk mitigation strategies, with particular focus on the three critical risks and the high-risk stories in Epic 2 and Epic 4.
