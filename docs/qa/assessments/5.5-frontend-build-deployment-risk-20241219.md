## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

*No critical risks requiring immediate testing focus.*

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests

- PERF-001: Frontend build performance and optimization testing
- Load testing and performance benchmarking
- Build optimization and bundle size analysis

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests

- Frontend security testing and vulnerability assessment
- Frontend loading and rendering performance testing
- Frontend deployment and rollback procedure testing
- Frontend integration and compatibility testing

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

*No risks require immediate fixes before production deployment.*

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- PERF-001: Implement frontend build optimization and performance monitoring
- SEC-001: Implement comprehensive frontend security testing
- OPS-001: Implement robust frontend deployment and rollback procedures

### Accepted Risks

*No risks accepted without mitigation.*

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- Frontend build performance and optimization metrics
- Frontend loading and rendering performance
- Frontend deployment success rates and rollback effectiveness
- Frontend security and vulnerability monitoring

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- Frontend performance requirements change
- Frontend security requirements are updated
- Frontend deployment procedures change
- Frontend technology stack is updated
