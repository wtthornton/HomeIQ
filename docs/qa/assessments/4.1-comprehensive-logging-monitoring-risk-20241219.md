## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 8
- Critical Risks: 0
- High Risks: 2
- Risk Score: 72/100 (calculated)

## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

*No critical risks identified, but two high-risk items require attention.*

## Risk Distribution

### By Category

- Security: 1 risk (0 high)
- Performance: 2 risks (1 high)
- Data: 1 risk (0 high)
- Business: 0 risks
- Operational: 3 risks (1 high)
- Technical: 1 risk (0 high)

### By Component

- Logging System: 3 risks
- Monitoring: 3 risks
- Alerting: 2 risks

## Detailed Risk Register

| Risk ID | Description | Probability | Impact | Score | Priority |
|---------|-------------|-------------|---------|-------|----------|
| PERF-001 | Logging overhead impacting system performance | Medium (2) | High (3) | 6 | High |
| OPS-001 | Log aggregation failures causing monitoring gaps | Medium (2) | High (3) | 6 | High |
| SEC-001 | Sensitive data exposure in logs | Low (1) | Medium (2) | 2 | Low |
| DATA-001 | Log rotation and retention policy failures | Medium (2) | Medium (2) | 4 | Medium |
| PERF-002 | Monitoring overhead on system resources | Low (1) | Medium (2) | 2 | Low |
| OPS-002 | Alert fatigue and notification management | Medium (2) | Medium (2) | 4 | Medium |
| OPS-003 | Dashboard performance under high data volume | Low (1) | Medium (2) | 2 | Low |
| TECH-001 | Log parsing and indexing errors | Low (1) | Medium (2) | 2 | Low |

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

*No critical risks requiring immediate testing focus.*

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests

- PERF-001: Performance impact testing of logging systems
- OPS-001: Log aggregation failure simulation and recovery testing
- Monitoring gap detection and prevention testing

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests

- Log rotation and retention policy validation
- Alert management and fatigue prevention testing
- Dashboard performance testing under load
- Log parsing and indexing accuracy testing

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

*No risks require immediate fixes before production deployment.*

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- PERF-001: Optimize logging for minimal performance impact
- OPS-001: Implement robust log aggregation with failover mechanisms
- DATA-001: Implement comprehensive log rotation and retention policies
- OPS-002: Implement alert management and fatigue prevention

### Accepted Risks

*No risks accepted without mitigation.*

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- Logging system performance impact
- Log aggregation success rates and gaps
- Log rotation and retention compliance
- Alert effectiveness and fatigue levels

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- Logging requirements change
- Monitoring requirements are updated
- Alert thresholds are modified
- Performance requirements change
