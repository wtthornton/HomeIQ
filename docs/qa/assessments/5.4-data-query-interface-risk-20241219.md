## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

*No critical risks requiring immediate testing focus.*

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests

- PERF-001: Query performance testing with large datasets
- DATA-001: Query result accuracy and consistency testing
- PERF-002: Query interface load testing and performance optimization

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests

- Query access control and security testing
- Query parameter validation and sanitization testing
- Query caching and optimization testing
- Query error handling and user experience testing

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

*No risks require immediate fixes before production deployment.*

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- PERF-001: Implement query performance optimization and caching
- DATA-001: Implement comprehensive query result validation
- PERF-002: Implement query interface performance optimization
- SEC-001: Implement robust query access control and security

### Accepted Risks

*No risks accepted without mitigation.*

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- Query performance and response times
- Query result accuracy and consistency
- Query interface usage and performance metrics
- Query access control and security effectiveness

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- Query performance requirements change
- Data volume or complexity increases
- Query security requirements are updated
- Query interface functionality is expanded
