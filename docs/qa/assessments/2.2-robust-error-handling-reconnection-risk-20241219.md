**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium - Complex error scenarios not fully covered
**Impact**: High - Service degradation and data loss
**Mitigation**:

- Implement comprehensive error categorization
- Add fallback mechanisms for all error types
- Create error handling test scenarios

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

- TECH-001: Chaos engineering tests for connection storms
- Cascading failure simulation and recovery testing
- Connection backoff and jitter algorithm validation

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests

- OPS-001: Comprehensive error scenario testing
- DATA-001: Data loss prevention during reconnection tests
- Error handling coverage analysis and gap testing

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests

- Retry logic and resource exhaustion testing
- Data recovery and consistency validation
- Performance impact testing during reconnection

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- TECH-001: All connection storm risks must be mitigated with proper backoff algorithms

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- OPS-001: Comprehensive error handling coverage must be implemented
- DATA-001: Data loss prevention mechanisms must be in place

### Accepted Risks

*No risks accepted without mitigation.*

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- Connection storm detection and prevention
- Error handling coverage and success rates
- Data loss rates during reconnection attempts
- Retry logic effectiveness and resource usage

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- Error handling requirements change
- Reconnection logic is modified
- Service dependencies change
- Performance requirements are updated
