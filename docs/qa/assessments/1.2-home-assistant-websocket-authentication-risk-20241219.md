- Critical Risks: 0
- High Risks: 1
- Risk Score: 80/100 (calculated)

## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

*No critical risks identified, but one high-risk item requires attention.*

## Risk Distribution

### By Category

- Security: 2 risks (1 high)
- Performance: 0 risks
- Data: 0 risks
- Business: 0 risks
- Operational: 2 risks (0 high)
- Technical: 1 risk (0 high)

### By Component

- WebSocket Client: 3 risks
- Authentication: 2 risks
- Infrastructure: 0 risks

## Detailed Risk Register

| Risk ID | Description | Probability | Impact | Score | Priority |
|---------|-------------|-------------|---------|-------|----------|
| SEC-001 | Token exposure in logs or error messages | Medium (2) | High (3) | 6 | High |
| SEC-002 | Insufficient token validation and format checking | Low (1) | Medium (2) | 2 | Low |
| TECH-001 | WebSocket connection stability under network issues | Medium (2) | Medium (2) | 4 | Medium |
| OPS-001 | Authentication failure handling and recovery | Medium (2) | Medium (2) | 4 | Medium |
| OPS-002 | Health check accuracy during authentication failures | Low (1) | Medium (2) | 2 | Low |

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

*No critical risks requiring immediate testing focus.*

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests

- SEC-001: Token masking and sanitization tests
- Security testing for token exposure scenarios
- Log analysis for sensitive data leakage

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests

- WebSocket connection stability tests under various network conditions
- Authentication failure and recovery testing
- Health check accuracy during different failure states
- Token validation and format checking tests

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

*No risks require immediate fixes before production deployment.*

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- SEC-001: Implement comprehensive token masking in all logs and error messages
- TECH-001: Add robust connection retry logic and exponential backoff
- OPS-001: Implement comprehensive authentication failure handling

### Accepted Risks

*No risks accepted without mitigation.*

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- Authentication success/failure rates
- Token validation error rates
- WebSocket connection stability metrics
- Health check accuracy during authentication failures

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- Authentication mechanism changes
- Token format or validation requirements change
- Network reliability requirements change
- Security audit requirements updated
