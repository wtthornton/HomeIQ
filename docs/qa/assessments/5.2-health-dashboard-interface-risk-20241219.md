## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

*No critical risks requiring immediate testing focus.*

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests

- PERF-001: Dashboard performance testing under high data volume
- Load testing with multiple concurrent users
- Data visualization performance optimization testing

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests

- Dashboard access control and authentication testing
- Real-time data accuracy and consistency testing
- Dashboard error handling and user experience testing
- Dashboard configuration and customization testing

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

*No risks require immediate fixes before production deployment.*

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- PERF-001: Implement dashboard performance optimization and caching
- SEC-001: Implement comprehensive dashboard access control
- DATA-001: Implement real-time data validation and consistency checks

### Accepted Risks

*No risks accepted without mitigation.*

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- Dashboard performance and response times
- Dashboard access and authentication success rates
- Real-time data accuracy and consistency
- Dashboard usage and user experience metrics

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- Dashboard performance requirements change
- Data volume or complexity increases
- User access requirements change
- Dashboard functionality is expanded
