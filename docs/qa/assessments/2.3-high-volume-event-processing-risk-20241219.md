Date: 2024-12-19
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 9
- Critical Risks: 1
- High Risks: 3
- Risk Score: 52/100 (calculated)

## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. PERF-001: System Overload Under Peak Load

**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High - High-volume events can overwhelm system resources
**Impact**: High - Complete system failure and data loss
**Mitigation**:

- Implement comprehensive load balancing and throttling
- Add circuit breakers and backpressure mechanisms
- Create horizontal scaling capabilities
**Testing Focus**: Load testing at 10x expected peak volume, chaos engineering for overload scenarios

### 2. DATA-001: Event Loss Under High Volume

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium - Queue overflow and processing bottlenecks
**Impact**: High - Permanent data loss and analytics gaps
**Mitigation**:

- Implement persistent queuing with overflow handling
- Add event prioritization and selective processing
- Create data recovery mechanisms

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

- PERF-001: Load testing at 10x expected peak volume
- System overload simulation and recovery testing
- Circuit breaker and backpressure mechanism validation

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests

- DATA-001: Event loss prevention testing under high volume
- PERF-002: Memory exhaustion and recovery testing
- OPS-001: SLA compliance testing under sustained load

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests

- CPU bottleneck and optimization testing
- Network bandwidth utilization monitoring
- Event ordering consistency validation

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- PERF-001: System overload protection must be implemented and tested

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- DATA-001: Event loss prevention mechanisms must be in place
- PERF-002: Memory management and cleanup must be implemented
- OPS-001: SLA compliance mechanisms must be validated

### Accepted Risks

*No risks accepted without mitigation.*

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- System resource utilization under load
- Event processing rates and queue depths
- Memory usage and cleanup effectiveness
- Processing latency and SLA compliance

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- Expected event volumes change significantly
- Performance requirements are updated
- System architecture changes
- SLA requirements are modified
