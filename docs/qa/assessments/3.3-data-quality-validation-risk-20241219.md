## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 7
- Critical Risks: 0
- High Risks: 2
- Risk Score: 74/100 (calculated)

## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

## Risk Distribution

### By Category

- Security: 0 risks
- Performance: 2 risks (1 high)
- Data: 3 risks (1 high)
- Business: 0 risks
- Operational: 2 risks (0 high)
- Technical: 0 risks

### By Component

- Data Validation: 4 risks
- Quality Monitoring: 2 risks
- Analytics: 1 risk

## Detailed Risk Register

| Risk ID | Description | Probability | Impact | Score | Priority |
|---------|-------------|-------------|---------|-------|----------|
| DATA-001 | False positive/negative validation results | Medium (2) | High (3) | 6 | High |
| PERF-001 | Validation overhead impacting processing performance | Medium (2) | High (3) | 6 | High |
| DATA-002 | Incomplete validation rule coverage | Medium (2) | Medium (2) | 4 | Medium |
| DATA-003 | Data quality metrics accuracy and reliability | Low (1) | Medium (2) | 2 | Low |
| PERF-002 | Quality monitoring overhead on system performance | Low (1) | Medium (2) | 2 | Low |
| OPS-001 | Validation rule maintenance and updates | Low (1) | Medium (2) | 2 | Low |
| OPS-002 | Quality alerting and notification management | Low (1) | Medium (2) | 2 | Low |

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

*No critical risks requiring immediate testing focus.*

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests

- DATA-001: Validation accuracy testing with known good/bad data
- PERF-001: Performance impact testing of validation processes
- False positive/negative detection and correction testing

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests

- Validation rule coverage analysis and testing
- Data quality metrics accuracy validation
- Quality monitoring overhead assessment
- Validation rule maintenance and update testing

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

*No risks require immediate fixes before production deployment.*

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- DATA-001: Implement comprehensive validation testing and accuracy validation
- PERF-001: Optimize validation processes for minimal performance impact
- DATA-002: Implement comprehensive validation rule coverage analysis

### Accepted Risks

*No risks accepted without mitigation.*

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- Validation accuracy and false positive/negative rates
- Validation process performance impact
- Data quality metrics and trends
- Validation rule effectiveness and coverage

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- Data quality requirements change
- Validation rules are updated or modified
- Performance requirements are updated
- Analytics requirements change
