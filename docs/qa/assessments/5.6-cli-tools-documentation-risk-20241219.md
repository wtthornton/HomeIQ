## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

*No critical risks requiring immediate testing focus.*

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests

*No high risks requiring focused testing.*

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests

- Documentation accuracy and completeness validation
- CLI tool error handling and user experience testing
- CLI tool performance and responsiveness testing
- CLI tool integration and compatibility testing

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

*No risks require immediate fixes before production deployment.*

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- BUS-001: Implement comprehensive documentation review and validation
- OPS-001: Implement robust CLI tool error handling and user experience
- OPS-002: Implement CLI tool maintenance and update procedures

### Accepted Risks

*No risks accepted without mitigation.*

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- Documentation usage and feedback
- CLI tool usage and error rates
- CLI tool performance and responsiveness
- CLI tool integration and compatibility

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- Documentation requirements change
- CLI tool functionality is expanded
- User experience requirements are updated
- System integration requirements change
