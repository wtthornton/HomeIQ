## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

*No critical risks requiring immediate testing focus.*

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests

- PERF-001: Query performance testing with large datasets
- DATA-001: Schema design validation for analytics requirements
- PERF-002: Storage capacity planning and growth testing

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests

- Data retention policy implementation testing
- Index optimization and query performance testing
- Backup and recovery procedure validation
- Schema migration and versioning testing

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

*No risks require immediate fixes before production deployment.*

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- PERF-001: Implement query optimization and indexing strategies
- DATA-001: Validate schema design against analytics requirements
- PERF-002: Implement storage monitoring and capacity planning
- DATA-002: Implement comprehensive data retention policies

### Accepted Risks

*No risks accepted without mitigation.*

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- Query performance and execution times
- Storage usage and growth rates
- Data retention policy compliance
- Database maintenance and optimization effectiveness

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- Data volume requirements change significantly
- Analytics requirements are updated
- Storage capacity planning changes
- Schema design requirements are modified
