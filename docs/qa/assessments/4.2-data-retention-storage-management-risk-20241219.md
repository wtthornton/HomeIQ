## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

*No critical risks requiring immediate testing focus.*

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests

- DATA-001: Data retention policy implementation and testing
- PERF-001: Storage cleanup performance testing under load
- OPS-001: Backup and recovery procedure validation testing

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests

- Data archival and compression accuracy testing
- Storage quota management and enforcement testing
- Data migration performance and integrity testing
- Storage monitoring and alerting effectiveness testing

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

*No risks require immediate fixes before production deployment.*

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- DATA-001: Implement comprehensive data retention policy validation
- PERF-001: Optimize storage cleanup for minimal performance impact
- OPS-001: Implement robust backup and recovery procedures
- DATA-002: Implement comprehensive data archival and compression

### Accepted Risks

*No risks accepted without mitigation.*

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- Data retention policy compliance and effectiveness
- Storage cleanup performance and impact
- Backup and recovery success rates
- Storage usage and quota management

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- Data retention requirements change
- Storage capacity planning changes
- Backup and recovery requirements are updated
- Storage system architecture changes
