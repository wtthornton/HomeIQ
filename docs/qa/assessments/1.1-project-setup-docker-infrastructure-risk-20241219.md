## Risk Distribution

### By Category

- Security: 1 risk (0 critical)
- Performance: 0 risks
- Data: 0 risks
- Business: 0 risks
- Operational: 1 risk (0 critical)
- Technical: 0 risks

### By Component

- Infrastructure: 2 risks
- Frontend: 0 risks
- Backend: 0 risks
- Database: 0 risks

## Detailed Risk Register

| Risk ID | Description | Probability | Impact | Score | Priority |
|---------|-------------|-------------|---------|-------|----------|
| SEC-001 | Default credentials in development environment | Medium (2) | Low (1) | 2 | Low |
| OPS-001 | Docker resource limits not configured for production | Low (1) | Medium (2) | 2 | Low |

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

*No critical risks requiring immediate testing focus.*

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests

*No high risks requiring focused testing.*

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests

- Standard functional tests for Docker Compose startup
- Environment variable validation tests
- Health check endpoint tests
- Service networking and communication tests

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

*No risks require immediate fixes before production deployment.*

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- SEC-001: Use environment variables for all credentials, never hardcode defaults
- OPS-001: Configure resource limits in production Docker Compose files

### Accepted Risks

*No risks accepted without mitigation.*

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- Docker container resource usage and health
- Service startup and connectivity
- Environment variable configuration validation
- Health check endpoint responsiveness

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- Docker Compose configuration changes significantly
- New services added to infrastructure
- Production deployment requirements change
- Security requirements updated
