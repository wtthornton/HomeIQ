## Detailed Risk Register

| Risk ID | Description | Probability | Impact | Score | Priority |
|---------|-------------|-------------|---------|-------|----------|
| PERF-001 | Event processing bottleneck under high volume | Medium (2) | High (3) | 6 | High |
| PERF-002 | Memory usage growth with large event queues | Medium (2) | Medium (2) | 4 | Medium |
| DATA-001 | Event data loss during reconnection | Medium (2) | Medium (2) | 4 | Medium |
| OPS-001 | Subscription restoration reliability | Medium (2) | Medium (2) | 4 | Medium |
| OPS-002 | Event validation failure handling | Low (1) | Medium (2) | 2 | Low |
| TECH-001 | WebSocket message parsing error handling | Low (1) | Medium (2) | 2 | Low |

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

*No critical risks requiring immediate testing focus.*

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests

- PERF-001: Load testing with high event volumes
- Performance testing under various event rates
- Memory usage monitoring during peak loads

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests

- Event processing reliability tests
- Reconnection and subscription restoration tests
- Event validation and error handling tests
- WebSocket message parsing edge case tests

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

*No risks require immediate fixes before production deployment.*

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- PERF-001: Implement event batching and queue management
- PERF-002: Add memory monitoring and cleanup mechanisms
- DATA-001: Implement event buffering during reconnection
- OPS-001: Add robust subscription restoration logic

### Accepted Risks

*No risks accepted without mitigation.*

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- Event processing rates and latency
- Memory usage and queue sizes
- Event loss rates during reconnections
- Subscription restoration success rates

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- Expected event volumes change significantly
- Home Assistant event patterns change
- Performance requirements are updated
- Reconnection logic is modified
