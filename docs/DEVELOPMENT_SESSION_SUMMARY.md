## 📝 Technical Notes

### AnimatedDependencyGraph Integration
- Uses existing health/statistics hooks
- Calculates events/sec from events/min
- Tracks active data sources automatically
- No breaking changes to existing code

### DataSourcesPanel Component
- Self-contained component with mock data
- Easy to replace mock data with real API
- Follows existing design patterns
- TypeScript typed interfaces

### Next Steps for Real Data
1. **Backend API** (Epic 12.2):
   - Add `/api/v1/metrics/realtime` endpoint
   - Add `/api/v1/data-sources/status` endpoint
   - Wire up real metrics calculation

2. **Replace Mock Data**:
   - Update DataSourcesPanel to use real API
   - Add error handling
   - Add loading states
