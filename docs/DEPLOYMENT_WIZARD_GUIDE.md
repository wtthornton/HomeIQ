## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Issue: "Docker not found"

**Solution:**
```bash
# Install Docker
# Linux: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/
# macOS: https://docs.docker.com/desktop/mac/install/
# Windows: https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/install/

# Verify installation
docker --version
```

#### Issue: "Authentication failed"

**Symptoms:**
- HTTP 401 errors
- "Authentication failed" message
- "Token validation failed"

**Solutions:**
1. **Regenerate token:**
   - Open Home Assistant
   - Go to Profile → Long-Lived Access Tokens
   - Delete old token
   - Create new token
   - Copy entire token (no extra spaces)

2. **Verify token length:**
   - Should be ~180 characters
   - Starts with `eyJ0`

3. **Check permissions:**
   - Ensure user has admin access
   - Token should have full API access

#### Issue: "Cannot reach Home Assistant"

**Symptoms:**
- TCP connection failed
- HTTP 000 error
- Timeout errors

**Solutions:**
1. **Verify Home Assistant is running:**
   ```bash
   # From another machine
   ping 192.168.1.100
   curl http://192.168.1.100:8123
   ```

2. **Check firewall:**
   ```bash
   # Allow port 8123
   sudo ufw allow 8123
   ```

3. **Verify URL:**
   - Use correct IP address
   - Include protocol (http:// or https://)
   - Default port is 8123

#### Issue: "WebSocket test failed"

**Solutions:**
1. **Install Python websockets:**
   ```bash
   pip install websockets
   ```

2. **Use correct protocol:**
   - HTTP → WebSocket (ws://)
   - HTTPS → Secure WebSocket (wss://)

3. **Check for proxies:**
   - Reverse proxies may block WebSocket
   - Configure proxy to allow WebSocket

---

## 🎯 Best Practices

### Security

1. **Delete CREDENTIALS.txt** after saving passwords securely
2. **Never commit `.env`** to version control (already in `.gitignore`)
3. **Use strong tokens** - regenerate if compromised
4. **Secure file permissions** - 600 for sensitive files
5. **Regular token rotation** - regenerate tokens periodically

### Deployment

1. **Run wizard first** before manual configuration
2. **Test connection** before full deployment
3. **Review configuration** before starting services
4. **Monitor logs** during first deployment
5. **Validate setup** after deployment

### Maintenance

1. **Backup `.env`** before making changes
2. **Re-run validator** after configuration changes
3. **Keep tokens secure** - never share or expose
4. **Update regularly** - check for script updates
5. **Document changes** - note any custom modifications
