# 🔬 Deployment Research Summary - HA-Ingestor to Running Home Assistant

**Research Date:** October 12, 2025  
**Project:** HA-Ingestor v4.0 (Production Ready)  
**Status:** Research Complete - Awaiting User Inputs

## 📊 Executive Research Summary

### Key Finding: This is NOT a Home Assistant Add-on

**Critical Understanding:** HA-Ingestor is a **companion application** that runs as a **separate service stack** and connects TO your Home Assistant instance via WebSocket API. It does not get "deployed into" Home Assistant like an add-on or integration.

### What HA-Ingestor Actually Is

## 🔌 Home Assistant Integration Method

### Connection Requirements

1. **WebSocket API Access**
   - Requires Home Assistant WebSocket endpoint
   - Default: `ws://homeassistant.local:8123/api/websocket`
   - HTTPS: `wss://your-ha-instance.com/api/websocket`

2. **Authentication**
   - Requires long-lived access token from Home Assistant
   - Created in: Profile → Long-Lived Access Tokens
   - Permissions: Read-only to state changes is sufficient

3. **Network Connectivity**
   - Direct network access (preferred)
   - VPN connection (acceptable)
   - Nabu Casa cloud access (works but has latency)

### Data Flow

```
Home Assistant State Changes
         ↓
   WebSocket Event
         ↓
 WebSocket Ingestion Service
         ↓
 Enrichment Pipeline
    ↓         ↓
Weather API   Other Services
    ↓         ↓
         ↓
    InfluxDB Storage

## 🔐 Security Considerations

### Required Secrets

| Secret | Purpose | Sensitivity | Storage |
|--------|---------|-------------|---------|
| HA Access Token | Home Assistant authentication | 🔴 Critical | Environment variable |
| InfluxDB Token | Database access | 🔴 Critical | Environment variable |
| Weather API Key | Weather data | 🟡 Medium | Environment variable |
| JWT Secret | API authentication | 🔴 Critical | Environment variable |
| Admin Password | Dashboard access | 🔴 Critical | Environment variable |
| Carbon API Key | Carbon data | 🟡 Medium | Environment variable |
| Pricing API Key | Electricity pricing | 🟡 Medium | Environment variable |

### Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit secrets to version control**
   - All sensitive files in `.gitignore`
   - Use environment files (`.env`, `env.production`)

2. **Use strong, unique passwords**
   - Generate with `./scripts/setup-secure-env.sh`
   - Minimum 16 characters for production

3. **Limit network exposure**
   - Run on private network if possible
   - Use VPN for remote access
   - Enable firewall rules

4. **Enable authentication**
   - Set `ENABLE_AUTH=true` in production
   - Use JWT tokens for API access
   - Regular token rotation

5. **Keep systems updated**
   - Regular Docker image updates
   - Security patches
   - Monitor CVEs

## 💡 Key Insights

### This is NOT an Add-on
The most important understanding: HA-Ingestor is a **separate application** that connects to Home Assistant, not an add-on that runs inside it.

### It's a Monitoring System
Think of it as an external monitoring and analytics platform for your Home Assistant data.

### Resource Planning is Critical
Ensure adequate resources are available before starting. Can't run on a Raspberry Pi 3 with Home Assistant already consuming most RAM.

### Start Simple, Scale Up
Begin with core services only, add optional enrichment later as needed.

### Network Stability Matters
Requires stable WebSocket connection to Home Assistant. Test thoroughly.
