## Technique Sessions

### Technical Architecture Deep Dive - 45 minutes

**Description:** Focused exploration of specific components, data flow, and implementation details for Home Assistant ingestion layer

**Ideas Generated:**
1. WebSocket API for real-time event capture from Home Assistant
2. REST API as alternative polling method
3. Home Assistant logging integration for historical data
4. Custom integration/add-on approach for direct event bus access
5. MQTT integration if HA publishes to MQTT
6. Database logging configuration in HA
7. File-based logging with log parsing
8. Data transformation pipeline with filtering and enrichment
9. Event enrichment with metadata (device location, type, user associations)
10. Data normalization (timestamp standardization, unit consistency)
11. InfluxDB as time series database choice
12. Comprehensive schema design with tags and fields
13. Weather API integration for environmental context
14. User presence detection for behavioral patterns
15. Hybrid processing approach (real-time + batch)
16. Single InfluxDB instance with 1-year retention policy
17. Multi-temporal pattern analysis capabilities (day/week/month/season/year)
18. Continuous queries for automatic downsampling
19. Docker Compose orchestration
20. Incremental implementation phases

**Insights Discovered:**
- WebSocket API provides lowest latency for real-time event streaming
