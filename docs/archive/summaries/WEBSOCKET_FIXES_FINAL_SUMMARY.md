## 🐛 Issues Found & Fixed

### Issue 1: DateTime Import Bug ✅ FIXED
**Severity**: HIGH  
**Impact**: Health endpoint was crashing  
**Fix Time**: 2 minutes  
**Status**: ✅ Resolved - removed duplicate import

### Issue 2: Enrichment Pipeline Connectivity ⚠️ KNOWN
**Severity**: MEDIUM  
**Impact**: Some events fail to forward to enrichment  
**Status**: 📋 Separate issue - to be addressed later  
**Note**: Does NOT affect websocket event reception
