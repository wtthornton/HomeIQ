## Detailed Migration Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup (Days 1-2)

#### 1.1 Deploy New Services
**Objective**: Deploy new microservices alongside existing system

**Actions**:
```bash
# Deploy new services with different ports
docker-compose -f docker-compose.new.yml up -d

# Services deployed:
# - websocket-ingestion-new:8001
# - enrichment-pipeline-new:8002  
# - data-storage-new:8004
# - admin-api-new:8003
```

**Validation**:
- [ ] All new services start successfully
- [ ] Health checks pass for all services
- [ ] No port conflicts with existing services
- [ ] Logs show proper initialization

#### 1.2 Setup Service Communication
**Objective**: Establish HTTP communication between new services

**Implementation**:
```python
# Test service communication
async def test_service_communication():
    # Test websocket -> enrichment
    response = await http_client.post(
        "http://enrichment-pipeline-new:8002/api/v1/events",
        test_event_data
    )
    assert response.status_code == 200
    
    # Test enrichment -> storage
    response = await http_client.post(
        "http://data-storage-new:8004/api/v1/events",
        processed_event_data
    )
    assert response.status_code == 200
```

**Validation**:
- [ ] HTTP communication working between all services
- [ ] Retry logic and error handling functional
- [ ] Service discovery working correctly
- [ ] Circuit breaker patterns operational

#### 1.3 Validate New Architecture
**Objective**: Ensure new architecture can handle expected load

**Load Testing**:
```python
# Generate test events at baseline rate
async def load_test_new_architecture():
    events_per_minute = 17  # Baseline requirement
    test_duration = 5  # minutes
    
    for i in range(events_per_minute * test_duration):
        event = generate_test_event()
        await websocket_new.forward_event(event)
        await asyncio.sleep(60 / events_per_minute)  # Maintain rate
    
    # Validate all events processed
    total_processed = await storage_new.get_event_count()
    assert total_processed >= events_per_minute * test_duration
```

**Validation**:
- [ ] New architecture handles baseline load (17 events/min)

        self.dual_write = True
    
    async def forward_event(self, event_data):
        results = []
        
        # Send to old system (existing)
        try:
            old_result = await self.old_system.process_event(event_data)
            results.append(("old", old_result))
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Old system failed: {e}")
            results.append(("old", False))
        
        # Send to new system (parallel)
        try:
            new_result = await self.new_system.forward_event(event_data)
            results.append(("new", new_result))
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"New system failed: {e}")
            results.append(("new", False))

    async def validate_consistency(self, time_range):
        """Compare data between old and new systems"""
        old_events = await self.old_storage.get_events(time_range)
        new_events = await self.new_storage.get_events(time_range)
        
        # Compare event counts
        assert len(old_events) == len(new_events), "Event count mismatch"
        
        # Compare event content
        for old_event, new_event in zip(old_events, new_events):
            self.compare_events(old_event, new_event)
    
    def compare_events(self, old_event, new_event):
        """Compare individual events for consistency"""
        # Compare core fields
        assert old_event["entity_id"] == new_event["entity_id"]
        assert old_event["state"] == new_event["state"]
        assert old_event["timestamp"] == new_event["timestamp"]
        
        # Compare enriched data (if applicable)
        if "weather" in new_event:
            assert "weather" in old_event or old_event.get("weather_enriched") == False
```

---

## Rollback Strategy

### Rollback Triggers
1. **Performance Degradation**: >20% performance drop
2. **Error Rate Increase**: >1% error rate
3. **Data Loss**: Any events lost during migration
4. **Service Failures**: Any service becomes unavailable
5. **Data Inconsistency**: Data integrity issues detected

### Rollback Procedures

#### Immediate Rollback (Emergency)
```bash
# Stop new services immediately
docker-compose -f docker-compose.new.yml down

# Restart old services
docker-compose up -d websocket-ingestion
docker-compose up -d enrichment-pipeline

# Validate system health
./scripts/validate_system_health.sh
```

#### Gradual Rollback (Controlled)
```python
# Gradual rollback procedure
class RollbackManager:
    async def gradual_rollback(self):
        """Gradually rollback traffic to old system"""
        # 1. Switch traffic back to old system
        await self.switch_traffic_to_old()
        
        # 2. Validate old system performance
        await self.validate_old_system()
        
        # 3. Stop new services
        await self.stop_new_services()
        
        # 4. Restore original configuration
        await self.restore_original_config()
```

### Rollback Validation
- [ ] Old system operational
- [ ] Performance restored to baseline
- [ ] No data loss
- [ ] All services healthy
- [ ] Monitoring functional
