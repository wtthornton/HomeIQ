## 🎯 My Recommendation as BMad Master

### **Recommended Path:**

**STEP 1: Test Epic 14 (1-2 days)**
- Deploy to staging
- Test on actual devices
- Validate and deploy to production

**STEP 2: Research for Epic 15 (0.5 days)**
```bash
@bmad-master
*context7-docs react-grid-layout customization
*context7-docs websocket react patterns
*context7-docs real-time updates react
```

**STEP 3: Execute Epic 15 (2.5-3.5 weeks)**
- Start with Story 15.1 (WebSocket - highest value)
- Then Story 15.2 (Live streams - high value)
- Then Story 15.3 (Customization - requires research)
- Finally Story 15.4 (Thresholds - nice to have)

**Why this order?**
- WebSocket provides immediate value (30s → 500ms updates)
- Live streams leverage WebSocket infrastructure
- Customization requires new dependency (research first)
- Thresholds are enhancement (can be last)
