# 🚀 Home Assistant Ingestor - Deployment Plan for Running Home Assistant Instance

## 📋 Executive Summary

**Project:** HA-Ingestor is a **companion application** that runs **alongside** your Home Assistant instance (not inside it). It connects to Home Assistant via WebSocket API to capture, enrich, and store events in a time-series database with advanced analytics.

**Current Status:** Production-ready, Docker-based microservices application  
**Deployment Complexity:** Moderate (requires configuration, network access, and resources)  
**Estimated Deployment Time:** 2-4 hours (including testing)

---

## 🎯 What This System Does

HA-Ingestor is a **separate service stack** that:
1. ✅ Connects to your Home Assistant via WebSocket API
2. ✅ Captures all state change events in real-time
3. ✅ Enriches events with weather, carbon intensity, electricity pricing, and more
4. ✅ Stores data in InfluxDB (time-series database)
5. ✅ Provides a modern web dashboard for monitoring
6. ✅ Offers advanced analytics and data export capabilities

**Important:** This runs as an **external monitoring system**, not as a Home Assistant add-on or integration.
