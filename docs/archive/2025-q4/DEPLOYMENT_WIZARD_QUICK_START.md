## 🎯 What We're Building

### Deployment Wizard (`scripts/deploy-wizard.sh`)

**Interactive script that:**
1. Guides user through deployment option selection
2. Collects Home Assistant connection details
3. Auto-detects system resources
4. Generates configuration files
5. Validates setup (using validator)
6. Provides next steps

**User Experience:**
```bash
$ ./scripts/deploy-wizard.sh

🏗️  HA-Ingestor Deployment Wizard v1.0.0

Where is your Home Assistant currently running?

1) Same Machine (localhost)
   ✅ Simplest setup, no network configuration
   Best for: Testing, development

2) Separate Machine (Local Network)
   ✅ Resource isolation, better performance
   Best for: Production, dedicated server

3) Remote Access (Nabu Casa or Cloud)
   ✅ Access from anywhere
   Best for: Cloud infrastructure

Select deployment option (1-3): _
```

### Connection Validator (`scripts/validate-ha-connection.sh`)

**Comprehensive testing script that:**
1. Tests TCP/IP connectivity
2. Tests HTTP/HTTPS endpoint
3. Tests WebSocket connection
4. Validates authentication
5. Checks API access
6. Generates detailed report

**Output Example:**
```bash
$ ./scripts/validate-ha-connection.sh

🔍 Testing connection to Home Assistant...

✅ TCP connection successful
✅ HTTP endpoint accessible (status: 200)
✅ WebSocket connection successful
✅ Authentication successful
✅ API access confirmed

Test Results:
  ✅ Passed: 5
  ❌ Failed: 0

🎉 All tests passed! Ready for deployment.

## 💡 Key Implementation Notes

### Security Considerations

- **Never log tokens** in plain text
- **Mask tokens** in all output (show first/last 10 chars only)
- **Set file permissions** to 600 for .env files
- **Generate secure passwords** using openssl or /dev/urandom
- **Backup existing configs** before overwriting

### User Experience Principles

- **Clear prompts** with examples
- **Colorful output** for better readability
- **Progress indicators** for long operations
- **Helpful defaults** (e.g., localhost for same-machine)
- **Graceful error handling** with recovery options
- **Confirmation before destructive actions**

### Cross-Platform Compatibility

- **Test on Linux, macOS, Windows**
- **Use POSIX-compliant bash** where possible
- **Provide PowerShell versions** for Windows users
- **Handle different command availability** (e.g., nproc vs sysctl)
- **Check for dependencies** (curl, Python, etc.)

---

## 📞 Next Steps

1. **Review Documentation**
   - Story document for detailed requirements
   - Implementation plan for project structure

2. **Set Up Development Environment**
   - Test bash script development
   - Install PowerShell (if Windows development)

3. **Start Development**
   - Begin with Task 1.1 (Wizard Framework)
   - Follow the phased approach
   - Test continuously

4. **Get Feedback**
   - Test with real users early
   - Iterate based on feedback
   - Update documentation
