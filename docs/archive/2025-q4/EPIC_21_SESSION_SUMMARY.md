# Epic 21: Dashboard API Integration - Session Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-13  
**Duration:** ~1 hour  
**Agent:** BMad Master  
**Status:** ✅ **Phase 0 Complete, Ready for Phase 1**

---

## 🎯 What Was Accomplished

### Phase 1: Analysis & Planning ✅ COMPLETE
1. ✅ Reviewed API documentation and call trees
2. ✅ Analyzed dashboard implementation at localhost:3000
3. ✅ Identified critical infrastructure gap (data-api not deployed)
4. ✅ Created comprehensive Epic 21 with 7 stories
5. ✅ Created deployment checklists and analysis documents

### Phase 2: Data API Deployment ✅ COMPLETE  
1. ✅ Fixed Dockerfile build paths
2. ✅ Fixed requirements.txt dependencies
3. ✅ Copied missing source files from admin-api
4. ✅ Built data-api Docker image
5. ✅ Deployed and started data-api service
6. ✅ Verified service is running and stable
7. ✅ Tested endpoints successfully

---

## 📊 Critical Discovery

**The Problem We Found:**
Epic 13 created a complete data-api service architecture to separate feature data from system monitoring, but **the service was never deployed**. The code existed, configuration was ready, but `docker-compose up data-api` was never executed.

**The Impact:**
- Dashboard expected data-api running on port 8006
- All feature tabs tried to connect to non-existent service
- Result: Connection errors, 502 Bad Gateway, broken features
- Only 4/12 dashboard tabs were functional (33%)

**The Fix:**
We deployed the data-api service, resolving:
- ✅ Dockerfile build configuration
- ✅ Missing Python dependencies (psutil, requests)
- ✅ Missing source files (15 files copied from admin-api)
- ✅ Service now running stable on port 8006

## 🔍 Technical Details

### Service Architecture (Now Deployed)

```
Dashboard (3000) - nginx
    ├─ /api/v1/health → admin-api:8003 ✅ System monitoring
    ├─ /api/v1/events → data-api:8006 ✅ Event queries  
    ├─ /api/devices → data-api:8006 ✅ Device/entity browsing
    ├─ /api/v1/sports → data-api:8006 ⚠️ Sports data (endpoint check needed)
    ├─ /api/v1/alerts → data-api:8006 📋 Alerts (to be implemented)
    └─ /api/v1/analytics → data-api:8006 📋 Analytics (to be implemented)
```

### Deployment Fixes Applied

**1. Dockerfile Corrections**
```dockerfile
# Build context is root (.), so paths relative to root:
COPY shared/ /app/shared
COPY services/data-api/src/ /app/src/
COPY services/data-api/requirements-prod.txt .
```

**2. Requirements Updates**
```text
# Added missing packages:
psutil==5.9.6      # For metrics collection
requests==2.31.0   # For HTTP requests in alerting service

# Removed invalid package:
influxdb-client-3  # Doesn't exist, using influxdb-client==1.38.0
```

**3. Source File Consolidation**
Copied 15 shared modules from admin-api to ensure all imports resolve correctly.

```

**Tasks:**
1. Update WebSocket URL in websocket.ts
2. Update message handling for data-api format
3. Fix real-time metrics integration
4. Test connection stability

- ✅ Health endpoint responds at http://localhost:8006/health
- ✅ Events endpoint accessible (verified)
- ✅ Port binding correct (0.0.0.0:8006->8006/tcp)
- ✅ nginx can route to data-api from dashboard
- ✅ Service runs stable (no restart loops)

**Story 21.0 Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE AND VERIFIED**

## 💡 Key Learnings

### 1. Epic "Complete" ≠ "Deployed"
Epic 13 was marked complete but deployment step was skipped. Always verify deployment as part of epic completion.

### 2. Dependency Management Critical
Missing even one Python package or source file prevents service startup. Comprehensive dependency auditing needed before deployment.

### 3. Incremental Verification Essential
Testing after each fix (Dockerfile→requirements→files) caught issues early and prevented compound problems.

### 4. nginx Routing Was Ready
Dashboard frontend and nginx configuration were already correct - only backend service was missing.

### 5. Shared Code Patterns
admin-api and data-api share many modules. Consider creating a shared library package to reduce duplication.

## 🎓 Lessons for Future Epics

1. **Always verify deployment** - "Code complete" should include "deployed and running"
2. **Dependency audit upfront** - Check all requirements before first deployment attempt
3. **Test shared module imports** - Services sharing code need careful dependency management
4. **Health check configuration** - Ensure health checks have appropriate timeouts
5. **Rollback plan essential** - Always have a way to revert if deployment fails
