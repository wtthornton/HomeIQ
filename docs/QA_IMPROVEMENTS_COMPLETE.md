## 📝 Migration Notes

### For Future Backend Integration

**To replace mock data with real APIs:**

1. **Data Sources:**
   ```typescript
   // Replace in DataSourcesPanel.tsx:
   const mockData = getMockDataSources();
   // With:
   const response = await fetch('/api/v1/data-sources/status');
   const data = await response.json();
   ```

2. **Analytics:**
   ```typescript
   // Replace in AnalyticsPanel.tsx:
   const mockData = getMockAnalyticsData(timeRange);
   // With:
   const response = await fetch(`/api/v1/analytics?range=${timeRange}`);
   const data = await response.json();
   ```

3. **Alerts:**
   ```typescript
   // Replace in AlertsPanel.tsx:
   const mockAlerts = getMockAlerts();
   // With:
   const response = await fetch('/api/v1/alerts?hours=24');
   const data = await response.json();
   ```

**Interfaces are already defined and ready to use!**
