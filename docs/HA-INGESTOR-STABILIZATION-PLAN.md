**Priority**: P1 - HIGH | **Effort**: 5-7 days | **Risk**: MEDIUM

**Objectives**: Comprehensive dashboard, configurable alerting, enhanced health monitoring
**Deliverables**: Monitoring dashboard, alerting system, health monitoring
**Success Criteria**: Dashboard operational, alerting configurable, monitoring comprehensive

### Phase 4: Optimization & Testing (Week 4)
**Priority**: P2 - MEDIUM | **Effort**: 3-5 days | **Risk**: LOW

**Objectives**: Performance optimization, enhanced testing, stability validation
**Deliverables**: Performance optimization, test coverage, stability validation
**Success Criteria**: Performance optimized, 95%+ test coverage, stability validated

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### High-Risk Items
1. **Data Quality Blindness** (Score: 9/10) - Data corruption risk
   - **Mitigation**: Implement validation system, real-time monitoring, automated reports
2. **Monitoring Blindness** (Score: 9/10) - System outages risk  
   - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive logging, centralized monitoring, alerting system
3. **Quality Alerting Gap** (Score: 9/10) - Quality degradation risk
   - **Mitigation**: Validation failure alerting, threshold monitoring, escalation procedures

### Medium-Risk Items
4. **Performance Monitoring Gap** (Score: 6/10) - System slowdowns risk
5. **Security Monitoring Gap** (Score: 6/10) - Security breaches risk

## Resource Requirements

### Time Estimates
| Phase | Duration | Effort | Complexity |
|-------|----------|--------|------------|
| Phase 1: Critical Infrastructure | 5-7 days | High | Low |
| Phase 2: Quality Monitoring | 5-7 days | High | Medium |
| Phase 3: Monitoring & Alerting | 5-7 days | Medium | Medium |
| Phase 4: Optimization & Testing | 3-5 days | Medium | Low |
| **Total** | **18-26 days** | **High** | **Medium** |
