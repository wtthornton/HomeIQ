## 🚀 Deploy Commands

### Option 1: Full Stack
```bash
# From project root
docker-compose up -d

# Verify
docker ps | grep sports
curl http://localhost:8005/health
curl http://localhost:3000
```

### Option 2: Services Only (for testing)
```bash
# Sports backend only
docker-compose up sports-data

# Dashboard only  
cd services/health-dashboard
npm run dev
```

---

## 🧪 Testing Commands

### Backend Tests:
```bash
cd services/sports-data
pytest tests/ -v
pytest tests/ --cov=src --cov-report=html
```

### Frontend Tests:
```bash
cd services/health-dashboard
npm test
npm run test:e2e
```

---

## 🌐 Access Points

After deployment:

| Service | URL | Purpose |
|---------|-----|---------|
| Dashboard | http://localhost:3000 | Main UI |
| Sports API | http://localhost:8005 | Sports data service |
| Sports Docs | http://localhost:8005/docs | Swagger UI |
| Admin API | http://localhost:8004 | Existing admin |

---

## ⚙️ Configuration Required

### Minimal (Works without API key):
```bash
# Services will start with mock/cached data
docker-compose up
```

### Optimal (With API key):
```bash
# Add to .env or docker-compose.yml
SPORTS_API_KEY=your_espn_api_key_here
SPORTS_API_PROVIDER=espn

# Then start
docker-compose up
```

---

## ✅ What Works Out of the Box

### Without API Key:
- ✅ Team selection UI
- ✅ Animated dependencies graph
- ✅ Empty states and wizards
- ✅ All UI components
- ✅ Static team data

### With API Key:
- ✅ **Everything above PLUS:**
- ✅ Real live game data
- ✅ Actual NFL/NHL scores
- ✅ Team records and stats
- ✅ Countdown timers
- ✅ Real-time updates

---

## 📊 Expected Performance

### On First Load:
- Dashboard: <2s
- Sports tab: <1s (cached teams)
- Dependencies: <1s (smooth animations)

### During Use:
- Real-time updates: Every 2-30s
- Animations: Solid 60fps
- API calls: ~36/day (3 teams)
- Cache hit rate: 80%+

---

## 🎯 Success Indicators

**You'll know it's working when:**

1. **Sports Tab:**
   - Empty state appears OR
   - Wizard opens for team selection OR
   - Live games display (if teams selected)

2. **Dependencies Tab:**
   - You see animated particles flowing! 🌊
   - Nodes are clickable
   - Metrics update every 2s
   - NFL/NHL nodes visible

3. **Console:**
   - No errors in browser console
   - Docker logs show "healthy"
   - API calls succeeding

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Sports API Not Responding:
```bash
# Check if service is running
docker logs homeiq-sports-data

# Test health endpoint
curl http://localhost:8005/health
```

### Dashboard Not Loading:
```bash
# Check dashboard logs
docker logs homeiq-dashboard

# Verify build
cd services/health-dashboard
npm run build
```

### No Animated Particles:
- Check browser DevTools console
- Verify SVG is rendering
- Check real-time metrics are fetching
