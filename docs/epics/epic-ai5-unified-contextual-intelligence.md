# Epic AI-5: Unified Contextual Intelligence Service

**Epic ID**: AI-5  
**Title**: Unified Contextual Intelligence Service (Phase 1 + Phase 2)  
**Status**: Planning  
**Priority**: High  
**Estimated Duration**: 10 weeks (4 weeks Phase 1 + 6 weeks Phase 2)  
**Value**: High (8/10)  
**Complexity**: Medium (5/10)  
**Created**: December 19, 2024  
**Last Updated**: December 19, 2024  

## Epic Description

Implement a comprehensive unified intelligence service that provides consistent contextual awareness across both automated batch processing and user-initiated queries. This epic includes Phase 1 quick integration enhancements and Phase 2 unified service architecture, eliminating the current architectural split and creating a seamless user experience.

## Business Value

- **Immediate Value**: Quick weather context integration for climate queries (Phase 1)
- **Consistency**: Users receive the same quality of contextual suggestions regardless of entry point
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Real-time queries include weather-aware, energy-aware, and event-aware suggestions
- **Code Reuse**: Single implementation of contextual intelligence eliminates duplication
- **Maintainability**: Centralized contextual logic easier to maintain and extend
- **Feature Parity**: User queries get same intelligence as automated suggestions

## Success Criteria

- [ ] **Phase 1**: Weather context works in Ask AI queries within 4 weeks
- [ ] **Phase 2**: All contextual patterns (weather, energy, events) work in both paths
- [ ] User queries include relevant contextual suggestions
- [ ] Daily analysis and user queries use the same contextual intelligence service
- [ ] Performance impact is minimal (<100ms additional latency for user queries)
- [ ] All existing functionality continues to work unchanged
- [ ] Contextual features can be enabled/disabled via configuration

## Timeline

### Phase 1: Quick Integration (Weeks 1-4)
- **Week 1-2**: Quick Weather Context Integration for Ask AI + Configuration
- **Week 3-4**: Testing and polish of Phase 1 features

### Phase 2: Unified Service Architecture (Weeks 5-10)
- **Week 5-6**: Unified Suggestion Engine Foundation + Energy/Event Context Integration
- **Week 7-8**: Ask AI Router Refactoring + Daily Analysis Integration
- **Week 9-10**: Advanced Configuration/Monitoring + Testing/Documentation

## Value Delivery Timeline

- **Week 2**: First Value Delivery - Weather context working in Ask AI queries
- **Week 4**: Phase 1 Complete - Weather context fully integrated and configured
- **Week 6**: Energy and Event Context - All contextual patterns available in unified service
- **Week 8**: Full Integration Complete - Both user queries and daily analysis use unified service
- **Week 10**: Production Ready - Comprehensive testing and documentation

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Performance Impact**: Implement caching and optimization strategies
- **Integration Complexity**: Use incremental integration approach
- **Configuration Complexity**: Start with simple configuration, enhance iteratively

### Timeline Risks
- **Dependency Delays**: Parallel development where possible
- **Testing Overhead**: Implement testing incrementally
- **Integration Issues**: Early integration testing

### User Experience Risks
- **Response Time**: Performance monitoring and optimization
- **Suggestion Quality**: A/B testing and user feedback
- **Configuration Complexity**: Sensible defaults and clear documentation
