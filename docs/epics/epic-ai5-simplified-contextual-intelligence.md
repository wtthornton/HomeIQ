# Epic AI-5: Add Contextual Intelligence to Ask AI

## Epic Overview

**Epic ID**: AI-5  
**Title**: Add Contextual Intelligence to Ask AI  
**Status**: Planning  
**Priority**: High  
**Estimated Duration**: 2 weeks  
**Value**: High (7/10)  
**Complexity**: Low (2/10)  
**Created**: December 19, 2024  
**Last Updated**: December 19, 2024  

## Epic Description

Add contextual intelligence (weather, energy, events) to the Ask AI router so users get the same smart suggestions in real-time queries as they do from the daily analysis. This is a simple integration that reuses existing contextual pattern detectors.

## Business Value

- **Consistency**: Users get contextual suggestions in both Ask AI queries and daily analysis
- **Immediate Value**: Weather-aware suggestions for climate device queries
- **Simple Integration**: Reuses existing contextual pattern detectors
- **Low Risk**: Minimal changes to existing working system

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Ask AI queries include weather context for climate devices
- [ ] Ask AI queries include energy context for high-power devices  
- [ ] Ask AI queries include event context for entertainment devices
- [ ] Performance impact is minimal (<50ms additional latency)
- [ ] All existing functionality continues to work unchanged
- [ ] Contextual features can be enabled/disabled via configuration

## Stories

### Simple Integration (2 weeks)
- [AI5.1: Add Weather Context to Ask AI](story-ai5-1-add-weather-context-ask-ai.md) - Feature (2 points)
- [AI5.2: Add Energy and Event Context to Ask AI](story-ai5-2-add-energy-event-context-ask-ai.md) - Feature (2 points)
- [AI5.3: Add Contextual Configuration](story-ai5-3-add-contextual-configuration.md) - Foundation (1 point)

## Timeline

### Week 1: Weather Context
- **AI5.1**: Add weather context to Ask AI router
- **AI5.3**: Add basic configuration system

### Week 2: Energy and Event Context
- **AI5.2**: Add energy and event context to Ask AI router
- **Testing and Polish**: Integration testing and performance validation

## Value Delivery Timeline

- **Week 1**: Weather context working in Ask AI queries
- **Week 2**: Complete contextual intelligence in Ask AI queries

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Performance Impact**: Use 1-day lookback instead of 7-day for real-time queries
- **Integration Complexity**: Reuse existing contextual pattern detectors
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback if contextual patterns fail

### Timeline Risks
- **Simple Scope**: Only 3 stories, 2 weeks total
- **Reuse Existing Code**: Leverage existing contextual pattern detectors
- **Minimal Changes**: Small modifications to existing Ask AI router

## Dependencies

- Existing contextual pattern detectors (WeatherOpportunityDetector, EnergyOpportunityDetector, EventOpportunityDetector)
- Ask AI Router (services/ai-automation-service/src/api/ask_ai_router.py)
- Data API Client, InfluxDB Client

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Weather context works in Ask AI queries for climate devices
- [ ] Energy context works in Ask AI queries for high-power devices
- [ ] Event context works in Ask AI queries for entertainment devices
- [ ] Performance requirements met (<50ms additional latency)
- [ ] Configuration system allows enabling/disabling contextual features
- [ ] All existing functionality continues to work unchanged

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All stories completed and tested
- [ ] Integration testing passed
- [ ] Performance requirements met
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Deployed to production
- [ ] User acceptance testing completed
