## Animation & Micro-interactions

### Motion Principles

**Purposeful Motion:** 
All animations should serve a functional purpose - indicating state changes, providing feedback, or guiding user attention. Avoid decorative animations that don't enhance usability.

**Performance-First:** 
Animations must not impact system performance or interfere with real-time data updates. Use CSS transforms and opacity changes for optimal performance.

**Accessibility-Aware:** 
Respect user preferences for reduced motion. Provide options to disable animations for users with vestibular disorders or motion sensitivity.

**Technical Clarity:** 
Animations should reinforce the technical nature of the interface - smooth, precise, and predictable rather than playful or whimsical.

### Key Animations

- **Status Changes:** Smooth color transitions (200ms ease-in-out) when service status changes from healthy to warning/error
- **Data Loading:** Subtle skeleton loading animation (800ms pulse) for data tables and metrics during fetch operations
- **Form Validation:** Immediate visual feedback (150ms ease-out) for form field validation states
- **Navigation:** Smooth page transitions (300ms ease-in-out) for web interface navigation
- **Command Execution:** Progress indicators with smooth progress bars (variable duration based on operation)
- **Log Streaming:** Subtle highlight animation (400ms ease-out) for new log entries in real-time streams
- **Configuration Changes:** Smooth state transitions (250ms ease-in-out) when configuration is applied successfully
- **Error States:** Gentle shake animation (300ms ease-in-out) for form validation errors

## Performance Considerations

### Performance Goals

- **Page Load:** Initial dashboard load within 2 seconds, subsequent navigation under 1 second
- **Interaction Response:** All user interactions (clicks, form submissions, queries) respond within 200ms
- **Animation FPS:** Maintain 60fps for all animations and transitions, with graceful degradation to 30fps on lower-end devices

### Design Strategies

**Data Loading Optimization:**
- Implement progressive loading for large datasets (load essential data first, then details)
- Use pagination and virtual scrolling for large data tables (events, logs)
- Cache frequently accessed data (configuration, recent events) in browser storage
- Implement data prefetching for predictable user navigation patterns

**Real-Time Updates:**
- Use WebSocket connections for real-time status updates with efficient data diffing
- Implement smart polling intervals (faster for critical metrics, slower for background data)
- Use request debouncing for user inputs to prevent excessive API calls
- Implement connection pooling and request queuing for external API calls

**Interface Responsiveness:**
- Use CSS transforms and opacity changes for animations to leverage GPU acceleration
- Implement skeleton loading states to maintain perceived performance during data fetches
- Use lazy loading for non-critical components and images
- Implement service worker caching for static assets and API responses

**Resource Management:**
- Optimize bundle sizes with code splitting and tree shaking
- Use efficient data structures for large datasets (avoid unnecessary object creation)
- Implement memory management for long-running sessions (clear old data, limit cache sizes)
- Use efficient rendering patterns (React.memo, useMemo) for complex data displays

## Next Steps
