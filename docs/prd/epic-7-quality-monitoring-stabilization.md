# Epic 7: Quality Monitoring Stabilization

## Epic Overview
**Epic ID**: 7  
**Epic Title**: Quality Monitoring Stabilization  
**Epic Goal**: Implement data quality validation system, quality metrics collection, and validation failure alerting  
**Epic Status**: Draft  
**Epic Priority**: P0 - CRITICAL  
**Epic Effort**: High (5-7 days)  
**Epic Risk**: Medium (new implementation)

## Epic Description
**As a** system administrator and operations team,  
**I want** comprehensive data quality validation and monitoring,  
**so that** I can ensure data integrity and detect quality issues before they impact the system.

## Business Justification
Current system lacks data quality validation, creating risks for data corruption and unreliable analytics. This epic addresses critical quality monitoring gaps identified in the stabilization plan.

## Epic Acceptance Criteria
1. **AC1: Data Quality Validation** - Comprehensive data validation system operational
2. **AC2: Quality Metrics Collection** - Quality metrics being collected and stored
3. **AC3: Validation Failure Alerting** - Validation failures trigger alerts
4. **AC4: Quality Dashboard** - Quality dashboard accessible for monitoring
5. **AC5: Quality Reporting** - Automated quality reports generated

## Epic Stories
### Story 7.1: Data Quality Validation Engine
**Goal**: Implement comprehensive data validation system  
**Priority**: P0 - CRITICAL | **Effort**: 2-3 days

### Story 7.2: Quality Metrics Collection
**Goal**: Set up quality metrics collection and storage  
**Priority**: P0 - CRITICAL | **Effort**: 2-3 days

### Story 7.3: Validation Failure Alerting
**Goal**: Implement validation failure alerting system  
**Priority**: P1 - HIGH | **Effort**: 1-2 days

## Technical Requirements
- Data validation engine with configurable rules
- Quality metrics collection and storage
- Validation failure detection and alerting
- Quality dashboard for monitoring and reporting

## Dependencies
- Phase 1 completion (logging and metrics infrastructure)
- Existing DataNormalizer class enhancement
- InfluxDB for quality metrics storage

## Success Criteria
- Data quality validation operational
- Quality metrics being collected
- Validation failures triggering alerts
- Quality dashboard accessible
- Quality reports automated

## Timeline
**Week 2: Quality Monitoring Implementation**
- **Days 1-2**: Story 7.1 - Data Quality Validation Engine
- **Days 3-4**: Story 7.2 - Quality Metrics Collection
- **Days 5-6**: Story 7.3 - Validation Failure Alerting
- **Day 7**: Integration testing and documentation

## Change Log
| Date | Version | Description | Author |
|------|---------|-------------|---------|
| 2025-01-04 | 1.0 | Initial epic creation for Phase 2 stabilization | BMad Master |

## Dev Notes
### Current State Analysis
**Existing Foundation**: Basic validation in DataNormalizer class, health check integration, error logging

**Gaps to Address**:
- Comprehensive data quality validation system
- Quality metrics collection and monitoring
- Validation failure alerting system
- Quality dashboard and reporting

### Implementation Strategy
1. **Enhance Existing Validation**: Build upon DataNormalizer class
2. **Add Quality Metrics**: Integrate with existing metrics collection
3. **Implement Alerting**: Use existing alerting infrastructure
4. **Create Dashboard**: Extend existing dashboard capabilities
