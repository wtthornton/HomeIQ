# User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision

The system prioritizes simplicity and reliability over complex interfaces. Users should be able to deploy and manage the ingestion layer with minimal configuration, focusing on data capture rather than complex analytics interfaces. The experience should feel like a "set it and forget it" service that quietly captures and enriches Home Assistant data in the background.

### Key Interaction Paradigms

- **Command-Line First:** Primary interaction through Docker Compose commands and CLI tools for technical users
- **Configuration-Driven:** Simple YAML configuration files for setup rather than complex web interfaces
- **Background Operation:** Minimal user interaction required once deployed - system operates autonomously
- **Status Visibility:** Clear health monitoring and logging for troubleshooting when needed

### Core Screens and Views

- **Docker Compose Setup:** Single command deployment with clear status output
- **Configuration Management:** YAML-based configuration for Home Assistant connection and weather API settings
- **Health Dashboard:** CLI-based status monitoring showing ingestion rates, data quality, and system health
- **Log Viewer:** Structured logging output for troubleshooting and monitoring
- **Data Query Interface:** Future web interface for querying historical data and basic pattern visualization

### Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA Compliant

**Implementation Status**: âœ… Complete (October 2025)

The Health Dashboard now implements comprehensive accessibility features:
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard support (Tab, Enter, Space, Esc)
- **Screen Reader**: ARIA labels, live regions, semantic HTML
- **Focus Management**: Visible focus indicators, modal focus trapping
- **Color Contrast**: 4.5:1 minimum ratio (WCAG AA)
- **Reduced Motion**: Respects user motion preferences
- **Touch Targets**: 44x44px minimum (WCAG AAA)

### Branding

The system maintains a clean, modern aesthetic that balances technical functionality with professional polish:

**Visual Identity**:
- **Professional yet Approachable** - Clean design with delightful micro-interactions
- **Status-First Design** - Color-coded health indicators (ðŸŸ¢ Green, ðŸŸ¡ Yellow, ðŸ”´ Red)
- **Technical Accuracy** - Information density without overwhelming users
- **Progressive Disclosure** - Summary at-a-glance, details on demand

**Design System**:
- **Colors**: Status-based palette (green/yellow/red/gray/blue)
- **Typography**: Clear hierarchy (36px hero â†’ 12px captions)
- **Spacing**: Consistent 24px grid system
- **Animations**: Subtle, purposeful (200-400ms)
- **Dark Mode**: Full support throughout

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

The system will primarily run on Linux servers, Windows with WSL2, or macOS with Docker Desktop. Any future web interfaces should be responsive and work across desktop and mobile devices for monitoring and configuration.
