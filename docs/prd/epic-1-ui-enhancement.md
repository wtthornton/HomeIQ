# Epic 1: Health Dashboard UI Enhancement

## Epic Overview

**Epic Goal**: Transform the existing health dashboard into a modern, visually appealing monitoring interface with preset dashboard layouts, advanced data visualization, enhanced real-time capabilities, and improved user experience while maintaining full backward compatibility.

**Integration Requirements**: All enhancements must preserve existing API contracts, maintain current functionality, and integrate seamlessly with the existing React/TypeScript architecture.

## Epic Scope

### Goals
- Transform the health dashboard into a modern, visually appealing monitoring interface
- Provide preset dashboard layouts optimized for different monitoring scenarios
- Implement modern data visualization with interactive charts and better indicators
- Enhance real-time capabilities with improved WebSocket integration and notifications
- Improve mobile experience and accessibility compliance
- Implement data export and historical analysis capabilities
- Create a dashboard that clearly shows system health and status at a glance

### Background Context
The current health dashboard serves as the primary monitoring interface for the Home Assistant Ingestor system. While functional, it lacks modern visual design and could better communicate system status. Users need a more visually appealing interface that clearly shows system health, modern data visualization, and better real-time monitoring capabilities. The enhancement will transform it into a modern, easy-to-understand monitoring platform while maintaining full backward compatibility with existing integrations and APIs.

## Functional Requirements

**FR1**: The enhanced dashboard will maintain full backward compatibility with existing API endpoints and data structures.

**FR2**: Users will be able to create, save, and manage custom dashboard layouts with drag-and-drop functionality.

**FR3**: The system will provide interactive data visualization with zoom, pan, filter, and drill-down capabilities for all charts.

**FR4**: Real-time notifications will alert users to system status changes, errors, and important events.

**FR5**: Users will be able to export dashboard data in multiple formats (CSV, JSON, PDF) with customizable date ranges.

**FR6**: Mobile users will have an optimized touch-friendly interface with responsive design improvements.

**FR7**: The system will provide comprehensive search and filtering capabilities for events, metrics, and configuration data.

**FR8**: The dashboard will support multiple themes and user preference management.

**FR9**: Historical data analysis will be available with configurable time ranges and comparison views.

## Non-Functional Requirements

**NFR1**: The enhanced dashboard must maintain existing performance characteristics with page load times under 2 seconds.

**NFR2**: The system must support concurrent access by up to 50 users without performance degradation.

**NFR3**: All new components must be fully accessible (WCAG 2.1 AA compliance) with keyboard navigation and screen reader support.

**NFR4**: The dashboard must be responsive and fully functional on devices with screen widths from 320px to 2560px.

**NFR5**: Bundle size increase must not exceed 30% of current size, with code splitting implemented for optimal loading.

**NFR6**: All new features must include comprehensive error handling with user-friendly error messages.

**NFR7**: The system must maintain 99.9% uptime during the enhancement deployment process.

**NFR8**: Data export functionality must handle datasets up to 100MB without browser timeout.

**NFR9**: WebSocket connections must be resilient with automatic reconnection and connection state management.

## Compatibility Requirements

**CR1**: All existing API endpoints and data structures must remain unchanged to maintain compatibility with backend services.

**CR2**: Current database schema and data models must be preserved without any breaking changes.

**CR3**: Existing UI components and design patterns must be maintained where possible, with new components following established conventions.

**CR4**: Integration with existing WebSocket services, configuration management, and authentication systems must remain intact.
