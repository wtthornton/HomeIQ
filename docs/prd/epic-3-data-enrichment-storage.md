# Epic 3 Data Enrichment & Storage

**Epic Goal:**
Integrate weather API enrichment and implement InfluxDB storage with optimized schema for Home Assistant events and pattern analysis. This epic transforms normalized events into enriched, analyzable data stored in a time-series database optimized for pattern recognition.

### Story 3.1: Weather API Integration

As a Home Assistant user,
I want events enriched with weather data,
so that I can analyze correlations between weather conditions and home automation patterns.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Weather API service fetches current conditions (temperature, humidity, weather conditions) for event location
2. Weather data is cached to minimize API calls and respect rate limits
3. Weather enrichment is applied to all relevant events with configurable location settings
4. API failures are handled gracefully with fallback to cached data or skip enrichment
5. Weather data includes timestamp and source information for data quality tracking
6. Rate limiting prevents exceeding API quotas with configurable request intervals
7. Weather service health is monitored and reported through health check endpoints

### Story 3.2: InfluxDB Schema Design & Storage

As a data analyst,
I want Home Assistant events stored in an optimized time-series database schema,
so that I can efficiently query historical data and perform pattern analysis.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. InfluxDB database is configured with proper retention policies (1 year default)
2. Schema includes optimized tags (entity_id, domain, device_class, location) for efficient querying
3. Fields store normalized event data (state, attributes, weather context) for analysis
4. Data is written in batches for optimal performance and reduced database load
5. Schema supports multi-temporal analysis (day/week/month/season/year patterns)
6. Database connection is resilient with automatic reconnection on failures
7. Storage usage is monitored and reported for capacity planning

### Story 3.3: Data Quality & Validation

As a system administrator,
I want comprehensive data quality monitoring and validation,
so that I can ensure reliable data capture and identify any ingestion issues.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Data quality metrics track capture rates, enrichment coverage, and validation failures
2. Invalid events are logged with detailed error information and discarded appropriately
3. Data validation ensures schema compliance before database writes
4. Quality metrics are exposed through health check endpoints for monitoring
5. Data quality reports are generated and logged for trend analysis
6. Validation failures trigger alerts for investigation and resolution
7. Data quality dashboard provides visibility into ingestion health and performance

**Technical Feasibility Assessment:**
Epic 3 is technically feasible with high confidence. Weather API integration uses standard patterns, InfluxDB is purpose-built for this use case, and data quality validation follows established practices. All performance requirements are achievable with modern hardware.
