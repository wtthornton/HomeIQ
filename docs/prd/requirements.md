# Requirements

### Functional

FR1: The system shall capture all Home Assistant state_changed events via WebSocket API in real-time with automatic reconnection on connection loss.

FR2: The system shall normalize all captured events to standardized formats including ISO 8601 UTC timestamps, unit conversion, and state value standardization.

FR3: The system shall enrich events with external weather data including temperature, humidity, and weather conditions from external API services.

FR4: The system shall store enriched events in InfluxDB with optimized schema including proper tagging (entity_id, domain, device_class) and field structure for efficient querying.

FR5: The system shall implement 1-year data retention policy with automatic cleanup of expired data to manage storage efficiently.

FR6: The system shall provide health monitoring with service health checks, logging, and automatic restart capabilities for production reliability.

FR7: The system shall support Docker Compose orchestration with all services (ingestion, database, weather API) configured and ready to run.

FR8: The system shall handle authentication with Home Assistant using long-lived access tokens for secure WebSocket connections.

### Non Functional

NFR1: The system shall achieve 99.9% data capture reliability with automatic reconnection and error handling for production use.

NFR2: The system shall process events with <500ms average latency from event generation to database storage.

NFR3: The system shall support 10,000+ events per day with sub-second processing latency for high-volume Home Assistant instances.

NFR4: The system shall maintain 99.9% uptime for ingestion service with automatic restart capabilities.

NFR5: The system shall store 1 year of data within 10GB storage per 1000 daily events for efficient storage management.

NFR6: The system shall respond to complex pattern analysis queries within 2 seconds for user experience.

NFR7: The system shall achieve 90% successful first-time deployments via Docker Compose setup.

NFR8: The system shall maintain 95% data enrichment coverage with weather and presence context data.
