# Epic 6: Critical Infrastructure Stabilization

## Epic Overview

**Epic ID**: 6  
**Epic Title**: Critical Infrastructure Stabilization  
**Epic Goal**: Implement comprehensive logging system, centralized log aggregation, and performance metrics collection to enhance system observability and operational readiness  
**Epic Status**: Draft  
**Epic Priority**: P0 - CRITICAL  
**Epic Effort**: High (5-7 days)  
**Epic Risk**: Low (foundation exists)

## Epic Description

**As a** system administrator and operations team,  
**I want** comprehensive logging, centralized log aggregation, and performance metrics collection,  
**so that** I can effectively monitor, troubleshoot, and maintain the HA Ingestor system with full operational visibility.

## Business Justification

The current system lacks comprehensive logging and monitoring infrastructure, creating operational blindness and making troubleshooting difficult. This epic addresses critical infrastructure gaps identified in the stabilization plan:

- **Operational Blindness**: Limited visibility into system behavior and issues
- **Troubleshooting Difficulty**: Scattered logs and lack of centralized monitoring
- **Performance Monitoring Gap**: No comprehensive performance metrics collection
- **Production Readiness**: Missing critical infrastructure for production operations

## Epic Acceptance Criteria

1. **AC1: Enhanced Logging Framework** - All services implement structured logging with consistent format and correlation IDs
2. **AC2: Centralized Log Aggregation** - All service logs are aggregated into a centralized system with search and filtering capabilities
3. **AC3: Performance Metrics Collection** - System collects and stores performance metrics for all services and components
4. **AC4: Log Rotation and Retention** - Implemented log rotation and retention policies to manage storage and compliance
5. **AC5: Log Analysis and Search** - Ability to search, filter, and analyze logs across all services
6. **AC6: Performance Monitoring** - Real-time performance metrics collection and basic monitoring capabilities
7. **AC7: Operational Visibility** - Dashboard or interface for viewing logs and performance metrics
8. **AC8: Documentation and Training** - Complete documentation and operational procedures for the new logging infrastructure
