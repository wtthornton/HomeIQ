# Epic 4 Production Readiness & Monitoring

**Epic Goal:**
Implement comprehensive logging, health monitoring, retention policies, and production deployment capabilities with Docker Compose orchestration. This epic ensures the system is production-ready with reliable monitoring, maintenance, and operational capabilities.

### Story 4.1: Comprehensive Logging & Monitoring

As a system administrator,
I want comprehensive logging and monitoring capabilities,
so that I can troubleshoot issues and monitor system health in production.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Structured logging captures all service activities with appropriate log levels
2. Log aggregation provides centralized logging across all Docker services
3. Performance metrics are tracked and logged (event rates, processing latency, error rates)
4. Health check endpoints provide detailed service status and metrics
5. Log rotation prevents disk space issues with configurable retention policies
6. Monitoring dashboard shows real-time system health and performance
7. Alert thresholds are configurable for critical metrics and failures

### Story 4.2: Data Retention & Storage Management

As a data analyst,
I want automated data retention policies and storage management,
so that I can maintain optimal storage usage while preserving historical data for analysis.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. 1-year data retention policy is automatically enforced with configurable settings
2. Automatic cleanup removes expired data without manual intervention
3. Storage usage is monitored and reported for capacity planning
4. Data compression optimizes storage efficiency for long-term retention
5. Retention policies can be modified without data loss or service interruption
6. Storage metrics are tracked and logged for trend analysis
7. Backup and restore capabilities protect against data loss

### Story 4.3: Production Deployment & Orchestration

As a Home Assistant user,
I want a complete production-ready deployment with Docker Compose orchestration,
so that I can deploy and maintain the system reliably in my home environment.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Docker Compose orchestration manages all services with proper dependencies and startup order
2. Environment configuration supports multiple deployment scenarios (development, production)
3. Service discovery enables proper communication between containers
4. Resource limits prevent services from consuming excessive system resources
5. Graceful shutdown procedures ensure data integrity during service restarts
6. Deployment documentation provides clear setup and maintenance instructions
7. System requirements and hardware recommendations are documented
