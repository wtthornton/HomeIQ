# Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Establish comprehensive historical data infrastructure for Home Assistant events with 99.9% data capture reliability
- Enable multi-temporal pattern analysis (day/week/month/season/year patterns) through optimized data schema
- Achieve one-command deployment via Docker Compose with <30 minute setup time
- Maintain enriched data with weather and presence context for 95%+ of events
- Handle 10,000+ events per day with sub-second processing latency
- Transform Home Assistant from reactive automation platform into data-driven smart home intelligence system

### Background Context

Home Assistant users currently operate in a reactive mode with limited historical data visibility. While Home Assistant excels at real-time automation and device control, it lacks comprehensive data analysis capabilities. Users cannot easily answer questions like "What are my energy usage patterns?", "When do I typically arrive home?", or "How do weather conditions affect my heating patterns?"

This ingestion layer addresses the critical gap where generic IoT analytics platforms lack Home Assistant-specific integration while enterprise solutions are over-engineered for home use. By capturing all Home Assistant events via WebSocket API, enriching them with external context (weather, presence), and storing everything in InfluxDB with a schema optimized for pattern analysis, we transform Home Assistant into a data-driven smart home intelligence system.
