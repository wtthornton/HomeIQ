# Next Steps

### UX Expert Prompt

Create a comprehensive UX design specification for the Home Assistant Ingestion Layer, focusing on the Docker Compose deployment experience, CLI tools, and future web interface considerations. Use the PRD as input to design user workflows, configuration interfaces, and monitoring dashboards that align with the technical user base and "set it and forget it" operational model.

### Architect Prompt

Create a detailed technical architecture specification for the Home Assistant Ingestion Layer, implementing the PRD requirements with Python, Docker, InfluxDB, and WebSocket technologies. Use the PRD as input to design the microservices architecture, data flow, error handling, and production deployment patterns that support 99.9% reliability and 10,000+ events per day processing capacity.
