## 📊 Architecture Documentation

### Current Architecture (Before)
```
Daily Batch (3 AM):
├── Fetch 30 days raw events (3M events)
├── Process all detectors (2-4 min)
├── Store pattern summaries to SQLite
└── Discard all processed data ❌
    └── Next day: Repeat for same 29 days ❌

Problems:
- 30x redundant processing
- High memory usage (200-400MB)
- Poor scalability
- Storage inefficiency
```

### Proposed Architecture (After)
```
Multi-Layer Storage:
├── Layer 1: Raw Events (InfluxDB, 7d, 700K events)
├── Layer 2: Daily Aggregates (InfluxDB, 90d, 900 records)
├── Layer 3: Weekly Aggregates (InfluxDB, 52w, 520 records)
└── Layer 4: Pattern Summaries (SQLite, forever, ~1K records)

Daily Batch (3 AM):
├── Fetch ONLY last 24h (100K events) ✅
├── Process Group A detectors (30 sec) ✅
├── Store daily aggregates to Layer 2 ✅
└── Query aggregates for historical analysis ✅

Benefits:
- 30x performance improvement
- 80% storage reduction
- Linear scalability
- Better reliability
```

## 🔍 Detector Grouping

### Group A: Daily Incremental (6 detectors)
**Process:** 24h data → Store to Layer 2

- Time-based Patterns
- Co-occurrence Patterns
- Sequence Patterns
- Room-based Patterns
- Duration Patterns
- Anomaly Patterns

### Group B: Weekly Aggregated (2 detectors)
**Process:** 7d aggregates → Store to Layer 3

- Session Patterns
- Day-type Patterns

### Group C: Monthly Contextual (2 detectors)
**Process:** 30d+ aggregates → Store to Layer 3

- Contextual Patterns
- Seasonal Patterns

---

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

### Epic-Level Success
- ✅ Daily processing time reduced by at least 3x
- ✅ Storage usage reduced by at least 50%
- ✅ All 10 detector types operational
- ✅ Pattern detection accuracy maintained (±5%)
- ✅ System stable for 7 days
- ✅ Migration completed without data loss
- ✅ Backward compatible with existing integrations

---

## 🚨 Risk Assessment

### High-Risk Items
1. **Pattern accuracy changes** → Extensive validation testing
2. **Data loss during migration** → Comprehensive backups
3. **Performance regression** → Benchmark before/after
4. **Storage growth** → Retention policies + monitoring

### Mitigation Strategy
- Phased rollout (Group A → B → C)
- Comprehensive testing at each phase
- Rollback plan ready
- Continuous monitoring
