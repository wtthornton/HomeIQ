# Epic 27: HA Ingestor Setup & Recommendation Service Foundation

## Epic Overview
**Epic ID**: EPIC-27  
**Title**: HA Ingestor Setup & Recommendation Service Foundation  
**Priority**: High  
**Business Value**: Critical  
**Estimated Effort**: 40 story points  
**Target Release**: Q1 2025  

## Business Context
The HA Ingestor Setup & Recommendation Service addresses critical user pain points in Home Assistant environment setup and optimization. This epic establishes the foundational infrastructure for automated environment health monitoring, setup assistance, and performance optimization.

## Problem Statement
Users struggle with complex Home Assistant integrations, leading to:
- Silent failures in device discovery
- Poor performance due to misconfiguration
- High support burden from setup issues
- Reduced user satisfaction and retention
- Suboptimal data quality from poorly configured systems

## Success Criteria
- Reduce HA setup time from hours to minutes
- Decrease support tickets by 60%
- Improve user onboarding completion rate to 85%
- Achieve 90% environment health score for active users
- Enable self-service setup for 80% of common integrations

## User Personas
- **Primary**: HA Ingestor users setting up Home Assistant integrations
- **Secondary**: Technical users optimizing existing HA environments
- **Tertiary**: Support team reducing manual setup assistance

## Epic Goals
1. **Environment Health Monitoring**: Real-time assessment of HA environment status
2. **Setup Automation**: Guided setup wizards for common integrations
3. **Performance Optimization**: Automated configuration optimization
4. **Continuous Monitoring**: Proactive issue detection and resolution
5. **User Experience**: Intuitive dashboard for setup and maintenance

## Technical Scope
- Backend health monitoring service (FastAPI with lifespan context managers)
- Frontend setup dashboard (React with useState/useEffect hooks)
- Integration with HA APIs (async/await patterns)
- Automated configuration management (SQLAlchemy 2.0 async sessions)
- Performance metrics collection (InfluxDB + SQLite hybrid)
- Recommendation engine (AI-powered with OpenAI integration)

## Context7 Validation
✅ **FastAPI** - Validated with `/fastapi/fastapi` (Trust Score: 9.9)
- Lifespan context managers for service initialization
- Dependency injection for session management
- Response models for API validation

✅ **React** - Validated with `/websites/react_dev` (Trust Score: 9)
- useState for component state management
- useEffect for real-time monitoring
- Context API for health status sharing

✅ **SQLAlchemy 2.0** - Validated with `/websites/sqlalchemy_en_20` (Trust Score: 7.5)
- async_sessionmaker for async database access
- Context managers for session lifecycle
- Proper transaction management

## Dependencies
- Home Assistant API access
- HA Ingestor core services
- User authentication system
- Configuration management system

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk**: HA API limitations
  - **Mitigation**: Fallback to manual configuration guidance
- **Risk**: Performance impact on HA systems
  - **Mitigation**: Lightweight monitoring with configurable intervals
- **Risk**: User resistance to automated changes
  - **Mitigation**: Opt-in automation with rollback capabilities
