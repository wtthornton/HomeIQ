## Sports Data Integration Epics (10-12)

**Epic 10: Sports API Integration (Archived)** ‚úÖ **COMPLETE** üóÑÔ∏è **ARCHIVED**
API-SPORTS.io integration with comprehensive player stats, injuries, and historical data. Archived in favor of free ESPN API (Epic 11).

**Epic 11: Sports Data Integration (ESPN)** ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**
Free ESPN API integration for NFL/NHL game tracking with team-based filtering and live game status.

**Epic 12: Sports Data InfluxDB Persistence** ‚úÖ **COMPLETE** üöÄ **DEPLOYED**
Persist sports data to InfluxDB with 2-year retention, historical query endpoints, and Home Assistant automation integration. All 3 stories delivered in ~5 hours (vs 9 weeks estimated). Primary use case: Flash lights when team scores! ‚ö°

## Architecture & API Separation Epic (13)

**Epic 13: Admin API Service Separation** ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**
Major architectural refactoring to separate admin-api into two specialized services:
- **admin-api (8003)**: System monitoring, health checks, Docker management (~22 endpoints)
- **data-api (8006)**: Feature data hub - events, devices, sports, analytics, alerts (~40 endpoints)

This separation improves performance, enables independent scaling, and reduces single points of failure.

## Dashboard Enhancement Epics (14-15)

**Epic 14: Dashboard UX Polish** ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**
Enhanced dashboard user experience with improved navigation, modern styling, and mobile responsiveness.

**Epic 15: Advanced Dashboard Features** ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**

## Quality & Monitoring Epics (16-18)

**Epic 16: Code Quality & Maintainability Improvements** ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**
Improve code maintainability for the personal home automation project. Simplify Dashboard component, add basic test coverage, and enhance security setup documentation.

**Epic 17: Essential Monitoring & Observability** ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**
Implement essential monitoring and observability features to ensure the Home Assistant Ingestor system is production-ready with proper visibility into system health, performance, and issues.

**Epic 18: Data Quality & Validation Completion** ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**
Complete the data quality and validation system that was identified as incomplete in QA assessments. This epic focuses on implementing the missing data quality components without over-engineering the solution.

## Device Discovery & Visualization Epics (19-20)

**Epic 19: Device & Entity Discovery** ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**
Discover and maintain complete inventory of all devices, entities, and integrations connected to Home Assistant. Provides visibility into system topology, enables troubleshooting, and establishes foundation for advanced monitoring features.

**Epic 20: Devices Dashboard** ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**
Interactive dashboard tab to browse and visualize Home Assistant devices, entities, and integrations. Reuses proven Dependencies Tab pattern for excellent UX. Provides easy exploration and system understanding.

## Integration Completion Epic (21)

**Epic 21: Dashboard API Integration Fix & Feature Completion** ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**
Complete integration of dashboard with Epic 13's data-api service structure and Epic 12's sports persistence features. Fixed broken/missing API connections across all 12 dashboard tabs, connecting:
- Sports tab to historical game data and InfluxDB persistence
- Events tab to query endpoints
- Analytics tab to real-time metrics
- Alerts tab to alert management system
- WebSocket to correct data-api endpoint

## Database Architecture Epics (22-23)

**Epic 22: SQLite Metadata Storage** ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**
Implemented hybrid database architecture with SQLite for metadata and InfluxDB for time-series. Delivered 3 stories in <1 day with ultra-simple implementation. Story 22.4 (User Preferences) cancelled as localStorage sufficient.

**Delivered:**
- ‚úÖ SQLite infrastructure with async SQLAlchemy 2.0 + WAL mode
- ‚úÖ Device/Entity registry (5-10x faster queries, <10ms)
- ‚úÖ Webhook storage (concurrent-safe, ACID transactions)
- ‚úÖ Docker volumes, health checks, 15 unit tests
- ‚úÖ Zero over-engineering, production ready

**Epic 23: Enhanced Event Data Capture** üöß **IN PROGRESS** ‚≠ê **HIGH PRIORITY** (3 of 5 stories complete - 60%)
