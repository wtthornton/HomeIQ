# Epic 2 Data Capture & Normalization

**Epic Goal:**
Implement comprehensive event capture from Home Assistant WebSocket API with data normalization, error handling, and automatic reconnection capabilities. This epic transforms raw Home Assistant events into standardized, analyzable data formats.

### Story 2.1: Event Data Normalization

As a data analyst,
I want all captured events normalized to standardized formats,
so that I can perform consistent analysis across different entity types and time periods.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. All timestamps are converted to ISO 8601 UTC format regardless of source format
2. State values are standardized (e.g., "on"/"off" to boolean, numeric values to appropriate types)
3. Unit conversions are applied consistently (temperature, pressure, etc.)
4. Entity metadata is extracted and normalized (domain, device_class, friendly_name)
5. Invalid or malformed events are logged and discarded without breaking the pipeline
6. Normalization preserves original data while adding standardized fields
7. Data validation ensures only properly normalized events proceed to storage

### Story 2.2: Robust Error Handling & Reconnection

As a system administrator,
I want the ingestion service to handle network interruptions and errors gracefully,
so that data capture continues reliably even during Home Assistant restarts or network issues.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. WebSocket connection automatically reconnects on network interruption
2. Reconnection attempts use exponential backoff to avoid overwhelming Home Assistant
3. Event subscription is re-established after successful reconnection
4. Connection failures are logged with detailed error information
5. Service continues operating during temporary connection loss
6. Maximum reconnection attempts are configurable with appropriate defaults
7. Health check endpoint reports connection status and reconnection attempts

### Story 2.3: High-Volume Event Processing

As a Home Assistant power user,
I want the system to handle high volumes of events efficiently,
so that I can capture data from busy Home Assistant instances without performance issues.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. System processes 10,000+ events per day with <500ms average latency
2. Event processing uses async/await patterns for concurrent handling
3. Memory usage remains stable during high-volume periods
4. Event queue prevents data loss during processing spikes
5. Performance metrics are tracked and logged for monitoring
6. System gracefully handles event bursts without dropping data
7. Processing rate is configurable to match Home Assistant instance capabilities

**Technical Feasibility Assessment:**
Epic 2 is technically feasible with high confidence. All requirements align with proven technologies and standard patterns. The performance requirements are reasonable for modern hardware, and the error handling patterns are well-established.
