# Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for **Home Assistant Ingestion Layer**, including backend systems, data processing pipelines, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

This unified approach combines what would traditionally be separate backend and infrastructure architecture documents, streamlining the development process for modern data ingestion applications where backend services and infrastructure concerns are increasingly intertwined.

### Starter Template or Existing Project

**N/A - Greenfield project**

This is a greenfield project with no existing codebase or starter templates. The architecture will be designed from scratch using proven technologies and patterns.
