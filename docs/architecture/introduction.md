# Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for **Home Assistant Ingestion Layer**, including backend systems, data processing pipelines, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

This unified approach combines what would traditionally be separate backend and infrastructure architecture documents, streamlining the development process for modern data ingestion applications where backend services and infrastructure concerns are increasingly intertwined.

### Project Status

**Production-Ready Brownfield System**

This project has evolved from a greenfield design into a mature, production-ready microservices platform with 21+ completed epics. The architecture has been refined through iterative development, with recent focus on API service separation (Epic 13) and dashboard integration (Epic 21).
