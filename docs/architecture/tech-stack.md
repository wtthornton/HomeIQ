## Technology Rationale

### Frontend Stack
- **React + TypeScript**: Provides type safety and excellent developer experience for complex dashboard interfaces
- **TailwindCSS**: Utility-first approach enables rapid UI development with consistent design system
- **Vite**: Fast build tool with excellent TypeScript support and hot module replacement
- **Vitest**: Vite-native testing framework with Jest compatibility for familiar testing patterns

### Backend Stack
- **FastAPI**: High-performance async framework with automatic OpenAPI documentation
- **aiohttp**: Lightweight async HTTP library perfect for WebSocket connections to Home Assistant
- **Python 3.11**: Latest stable version with excellent async/await support and performance improvements

### Data & Storage
- **InfluxDB 2.7**: Purpose-built for time-series data, perfect for Home Assistant sensor data
- **SQLite 3.45+**: Lightweight relational database for metadata (devices, entities, webhooks) with WAL mode for concurrency
- **SQLAlchemy 2.0**: Modern async ORM providing type-safe database access with excellent FastAPI integration
- **Hybrid Architecture**: InfluxDB for time-series events/metrics, SQLite for relational metadata (Epic 22)
- **Docker Volumes**: Simple, reliable local storage for development and production

### Testing Strategy
- **Vitest 3.2.4**: Fast, modern testing for React components with TypeScript support and enhanced performance (major upgrade from 1.0.4)
- **pytest 7.4+**: Comprehensive testing framework for Python services
- **Playwright 1.56.0**: Reliable E2E testing across multiple browsers with latest features
- **Puppeteer**: Browser automation for visual testing, screenshot verification, and UI regression testing
  - Comprehensive test suite: `tests/visual/test-all-pages.js` validates all pages against design specifications
  - Quick check tool: `tests/visual/test-quick-check.js` for fast single-page validation
  - Tests light/dark mode, design tokens, touch targets, and accessibility
  - See `tests/visual/README.md` for documentation

### Deployment
- **Docker Compose**: Simple orchestration for local development and production deployment
- **GitHub Actions**: Free CI/CD with Docker support for automated testing and deployment

### Sports Data Integration
- **Home Assistant Sensors**: Direct integration via Team Tracker and NHL HACS integrations
- **Frontend Access**: health-dashboard reads sensor entities via HA REST API (/api/states)
- **Polling Strategy**: 30-second polling interval for real-time game updates
- **Architecture Choice**: Simplified to use HA sensors directly, eliminating intermediate microservices

### Home Assistant Integration
- **API Endpoint**: http://192.168.1.86:8123 (REST API for device/entity queries)
- **MQTT Broker**: 192.168.1.86:1883 (Real-time event streaming) âœ… **CONNECTED**
- **WebSocket**: ws://192.168.1.86:8123 (Live event stream)
- **Authentication**: Long-lived access tokens for secure API access
- **Status**: âœ… **FULLY OPERATIONAL** - All connections established and working

**Note**: Sports data integration is handled directly through Home Assistant sensor entities (Team Tracker and NHL HACS integrations) via the health-dashboard frontend. Previous services (sports-api for API-SPORTS.io and sports-data for ESPN API) have been removed as they are no longer needed with the simplified architecture.

## Version Management

All versions are pinned to ensure reproducible builds and consistent behavior across development and production environments. Dependencies are managed through:

- **Frontend**: `package.json` with exact version pinning
- **Backend**: `requirements.txt` with version constraints
- **Infrastructure**: Docker image tags with specific versions

## Database Architecture (Epic 22)

**Hybrid Database Strategy** implemented to optimize for different data types:

| Data Type | Database | Rationale |
|-----------|----------|-----------|
| **Time-Series Data** | InfluxDB | Events, metrics, sports scores - optimized for time-range queries |
| **Metadata** | SQLite | Devices, entities, webhooks - optimized for relational queries |

**Benefits:**
- 5-10x faster device/entity queries (<10ms vs ~50ms)
- Proper foreign key relationships
- Concurrent-safe operations (WAL mode)
- ACID transactions for critical data

**Implementation:**
- data-api: SQLite for devices/entities (`data/metadata.db`)
- sports-data: SQLite for webhooks (`data/webhooks.db`)
- Both services: InfluxDB for time-series data

## Log Aggregation Service

**Technology:** Docker SDK for Python (docker-py) v7.1.0

The log-aggregator service provides centralized log collection from all running Docker containers for monitoring and debugging.

**Key Features:**
- Real-time log collection via Docker API
- In-memory aggregation of last 10,000 log entries
- RESTful API for log querying and search
- Filtering by service, log level, and time range
- Background collection every 30 seconds

**2025 Update (October 19):**
- âœ… **Upgraded to docker-py 7.1.0** - Full urllib3 v2.x compatibility
- âœ… **Removed deprecated dependencies** - Eliminated requests-unixsocket
- âœ… **Simplified initialization** - Context7 best practices for 2025
- âœ… **Successfully collecting logs** - 2150+ entries from 20 containers
- ðŸ“Š **Performance:** < 1s to collect 1000 log entries, < 128MB memory usage

**API Endpoints:**
- `GET /health` - Service health and log count
- `GET /api/v1/logs` - Retrieve recent logs with filtering
- `GET /api/v1/logs/search` - Search logs by query string
- `GET /api/v1/logs/stats` - Log statistics by service and level
- `POST /api/v1/logs/collect` - Manually trigger log collection

**Security Configuration:**
- Read-only Docker socket mount (`/var/run/docker.sock:ro`)
- Non-root user execution (UID 1001)
- Group-based socket access (GID 0 via group_add)
- No privileged mode required

## System Status (October 19, 2025)

### âœ… **CURRENT STATUS: FULLY OPERATIONAL**

- **Documentation**: Updated all docs with correct IP addresses

## Future Technology Considerations

- **State Management**: Consider Redux Toolkit if state complexity grows
- **Database**: Current hybrid architecture (InfluxDB + SQLite) excellent for current scale
- **PostgreSQL**: Consider if need multi-server writes or >10k devices
- **Caching**: Redis could be added for API response caching if needed
