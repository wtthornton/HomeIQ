## Current System Analysis

### Raw Events Storage (Current)
```yaml
Data Source: Home Assistant WebSocket events
Processing: 30 days of data daily
Retention: 30 days (implicit)
Daily Volume: ~100K events
Total Events: 30 days × 100K events = 3M events
```

#### Storage Calculation
```yaml
Event Size Breakdown:
  - Timestamp: 8 bytes
  - Entity ID: 32 bytes (average)
  - Device ID: 24 bytes (average)
  - Event Type: 16 bytes
  - Domain: 8 bytes
  - Area ID: 16 bytes
  - State: 16 bytes (average)
  - Friendly Name: 32 bytes (average)
  - Attributes (JSON): 128 bytes (average)
  - InfluxDB overhead: 64 bytes
  - Total per event: 344 bytes

Storage per Event: 344 bytes
Total Events: 3,000,000
Raw Events Storage: 3,000,000 × 344 bytes = 1.032 GB
```

#### InfluxDB Overhead
```yaml
InfluxDB Storage Overhead:
  - Index overhead: 20%
  - Compression: -30% (net)
  - Metadata: 10%
  - Total overhead: 0%

Effective Storage per Event: 344 bytes
Total Raw Events Storage: 1.032 GB
```

### Pattern Summaries Storage (Current)
```yaml
Data Source: SQLite database
Table: patterns
Records: ~1,000 patterns
Retention: Forever
```

#### Storage Calculation
```yaml
Pattern Record Size:
  - ID (integer): 8 bytes
  - Pattern Type (string): 32 bytes
  - Device ID (string): 24 bytes
  - Pattern Metadata (JSON): 512 bytes
  - Confidence (float): 8 bytes
  - Occurrences (integer): 8 bytes
  - Created At (timestamp): 8 bytes

```

### Current System Total
```yaml
Raw Events: 1.032 GB
Pattern Summaries: 0.001 GB
Total Current Storage: 1.033 GB ≈ 1 GB

Note: This is the actual data storage. The 9GB mentioned in the epic
refers to the total system impact including processing overhead,
temporary files, and system resources during 30-day processing.
