## Accessing the Dependencies Tab

1. Open the Health Dashboard at `http://localhost:3000`
2. Click on the "Dependencies" tab
3. Metrics will automatically refresh every 5 seconds

## Understanding the Metrics

### Top-Level Metrics Cards

The Dependencies tab displays five key metrics at the top:

#### 1. **Events/sec** (Green)
- **What it shows**: Current rate of events being processed across all services
- **Interpretation**:
  - `> 1.0`: High activity - system is actively processing events
  - `0.1-1.0`: Normal activity - steady event processing
  - `< 0.1` or `0.0`: Low/no activity - check if data sources are active

#### 2. **Active APIs** (Blue)
- **What it shows**: Number of services currently processing events
- **Interpretation**:
  - High number (8-15): Most services are operational
  - Medium number (4-7): Some services may be idle or down
  - Low number (0-3): System health issue - investigate inactive services

#### 3. **Inactive APIs** (Red)
- **What it shows**: Number of services responding but not processing events
- **Interpretation**:
  - `0-2`: Normal - some services may be intentionally idle
  - `3-5`: Check if external data sources are configured
  - `> 5`: Potential configuration issue

#### 4. **Error APIs** (Orange)
- **What it shows**: Number of services experiencing errors or timeouts
- **Interpretation**:
  - `0`: All services healthy
  - `1-2`: Minor issues - check error messages
  - `> 2`: System health concern - investigate urgently

#### 5. **Health Score %** (Purple)
- **What it shows**: Overall system health percentage
- **Interpretation**:
  - `90-100%`: Excellent health
  - `75-89%`: Good health - minor issues
  - `50-74%`: Degraded health - attention needed
  - `< 50%`: Poor health - immediate action required

## Per-API Metrics Table

The table below the metrics cards shows detailed information for each service:

### Column Descriptions

#### Service
- **Format**: Service name in monospace font
- **Example**: `websocket-ingestion`, `data-api`

#### Events/sec
- **Format**: Decimal number (2 decimal places)
- **Example**: `2.50`, `0.75`, `0.00`
- **What it means**: Current event processing rate for this service

#### Events/hour
- **Format**: Whole number
- **Example**: `9000`, `2700`, `0`
- **What it means**: Projected hourly event count based on current rate
- **Calculation**: Events/sec Ã— 3600

#### Uptime
- **Format**: Human-readable time
- **Examples**:
  - `45m 30s` - Service running for 45 minutes
  - `2h 15m` - Service running for 2 hours and 15 minutes
  - `5h 30m` - Service running for 5+ hours

#### Status
- **Format**: Color-coded badge with optional error message
- **Possible Values**:
  - ðŸŸ¢ **active** (Green) - Service is healthy and processing events
  - ðŸŸ¡ **inactive** (Yellow) - Service is running but not processing events
  - ðŸŸ  **timeout** (Orange) - Service didn't respond within timeout period
  - âš« **not_configured** (Gray) - Service URL not configured in admin-api
  - ðŸ”´ **error** (Red) - Service returned an error

### Status Interpretation Guide

#### ðŸŸ¢ Active Status
- **Meaning**: Service is operating normally
- **Action**: None required
- **Expected for**: websocket-ingestion, data-api, enrichment-pipeline (when HA is connected)

#### ðŸŸ¡ Inactive Status
- **Meaning**: Service is responding to health checks but not processing events
- **Possible Reasons**:
  - No incoming data from upstream services
  - Service is configured but data source is disabled
  - Legitimate idle state (e.g., calendar service with no upcoming events)
- **Action**: 
  - Check if this is expected (some services may be idle by design)
  - Verify upstream data sources are configured
  - Check service-specific configuration

#### ðŸŸ  Timeout Status
- **Meaning**: Service didn't respond within the allocated timeout (3-10 seconds)
- **Possible Reasons**:
  - Service is overloaded or experiencing high latency
  - Network connectivity issue
  - Service is starting up or restarting
- **Action**:
  - Check service logs for errors
  - Verify service is running: `docker ps | grep service-name`
  - Check network connectivity between services
  - Consider increasing timeout if service legitimately needs more time

#### âš« Not Configured Status
- **Meaning**: Service URL is not configured in the admin-api
- **Possible Reasons**:
  - Service is not deployed in this environment
  - Service URL mapping is missing
  - Service is optional and intentionally not configured
- **Action**:
  - If service should be available, add URL to admin-api service_urls
  - If service is optional, this status is acceptable

#### ðŸ”´ Error Status
- **Meaning**: Service returned an HTTP error or exception
- **Error Messages**: Displayed below the status badge
- **Possible Reasons**:
  - Service is experiencing internal errors
  - Service dependencies (database, external API) are unavailable
  - Code bug or unhandled exception
- **Action**:
  - Read the error message for specific details
  - Check service logs for stack traces
  - Verify service dependencies are healthy
  - Restart service if needed: `docker restart service-name`

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: All Services Inactive
**Symptoms**:
- Active APIs: 0
- Inactive APIs: 15
- All services show "inactive" status

**Likely Cause**: Home Assistant is not connected or not sending events

**Solution**:
1. Check Home Assistant connection in websocket-ingestion logs
2. Verify HA_WS_URL and HA_TOKEN are correctly configured
3. Check Home Assistant is running and accessible

### Scenario 2: High Error Count
**Symptoms**:
- Error APIs: 5+
- Multiple services show "error" or "timeout" status

**Likely Cause**: System-wide issue (database down, network problem)

**Solution**:
1. Check InfluxDB is running and accessible
2. Verify Docker network connectivity
3. Check system resources (CPU, memory, disk)
4. Review service logs for common error patterns

### Scenario 3: Specific Service Always Timing Out
**Symptoms**:
- One service consistently shows "timeout" status
- Other services are "active"

**Likely Cause**: Service is slow, overloaded, or misconfigured

**Solution**:
1. Check service-specific logs
2. Verify service is not resource-constrained
3. Check if service is performing expensive operations
4. Consider increasing timeout for this service (requires code change)

### Scenario 4: Low Health Score Despite Active Services
**Symptoms**:
- Health Score: 60%
- Active APIs: 5
- Inactive APIs: 8
- Error APIs: 2

**Interpretation**: System is partially functional but degraded

**Solution**:
1. Identify which services are inactive/error
2. Determine if inactive services are expected to be active
3. Fix error services first (highest priority)
4. Investigate inactive services if they should be active

## Troubleshooting Tips

### Tip 1: Use Error Messages
- Error messages appear below status badges in red text
- They provide specific details about what went wrong
- Common errors:
  - `HTTP 500` - Internal server error
  - `Timeout after 5s` - Service didn't respond in time
  - `Connection refused` - Service is not running
  - `Not found` - Endpoint doesn't exist

### Tip 2: Check Service Logs
```bash
# View recent logs for a specific service
docker logs --tail 100 service-name

# Follow logs in real-time
docker logs -f service-name

# Check if service is running
docker ps | grep service-name
```

### Tip 3: Restart Troubled Services
```bash
# Restart a specific service
docker restart service-name

# Restart all services
docker-compose restart

# Check service health after restart
curl http://localhost:PORT/health
```

### Tip 4: Verify Network Connectivity
```bash
# Test connection to admin-api
curl http://localhost:8001/api/v1/real-time-metrics

# Test connection to a specific service
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/event-rate
```

## Advanced Features

### Polling Interval
- **Default**: 5 seconds
- **Modification**: Edit `DependenciesTab.tsx` and change `useRealTimeMetrics(5000)` parameter
- **Recommendation**: Don't go below 2 seconds to avoid overloading services

### Priority-Based Timeouts
Services have different timeout values based on their importance:
- **High Priority** (3-5s): websocket-ingestion, admin-api, data-api
- **Medium Priority** (5-10s): ai-automation-service, energy-correlator
- **Low Priority** (5s): External APIs, sports, weather

### Interpreting Events/Hour
- **Purpose**: Helps predict system load over time
- **Use Cases**:
  - Capacity planning: Will current rate cause issues over hours?
  - Trend analysis: Is event rate increasing or decreasing?
  - Alerting: Set thresholds for high event rates

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Monitoring**: Check the Dependencies tab at least once per day
2. **Health Score Alerts**: Investigate when health score drops below 80%
3. **Error Investigation**: Address error services immediately
4. **Baseline Establishment**: Learn your system's normal event rates
5. **Documentation**: Document expected inactive services (e.g., calendar may be inactive if no events scheduled)
