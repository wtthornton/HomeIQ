# Home Assistant Device Discovery - Research Summary

**Date:** October 12, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Research Complete  
**Next Phase:** Planning & Architecture

---

## What We Researched

**Goal**: Find the best way to discover, capture, and maintain up-to-date information about ALL devices, entities, and integrations connected to the Home Assistant instance that HA-Ingestor monitors.

**Current Situation**: We capture state change events in real-time, but we don't have a complete inventory of what's connected to Home Assistant.

---

## Key Findings üîç

### 1. Home Assistant Has 3 Data Layers

| Registry | What It Contains | Example |
|----------|------------------|---------|
| **Device Registry** | Physical/logical devices | "Philips Hue Bridge", "Nest Thermostat" |
| **Entity Registry** | Individual sensors/switches | "light.living_room", "sensor.temperature" |
| **Config Entries** | Integration configurations | "Hue Integration", "Weather API" |

**Relationship**: Config Entry ‚Üí Device ‚Üí Entity ‚Üí State (what we track now)

### 2. WebSocket API Has Registry Commands

Home Assistant's WebSocket API (which we already use) has commands to query all three registries:

```json
// Get all devices
{"type": "config/device_registry/list"}

// Get all entities  
{"type": "config/entity_registry/list"}

// Get all integrations
{"type": "config_entries/list"}
```

**This is perfect because we already have a WebSocket connection!**

### 3. Real-Time Updates Available

We can subscribe to registry change events:

```json
// Subscribe to device changes
{"type": "subscribe_events", "event_type": "device_registry_updated"}

// Subscribe to entity changes
{"type": "subscribe_events", "event_type": "entity_registry_updated"}
```

## Top 3 Solutions (Ranked)

### ü•á #1: Hybrid Event + Periodic Sync (RECOMMENDED)

**What**: Combine real-time WebSocket events with scheduled full syncs

**How It Works**:
1. **Startup**: Get full inventory (all devices, entities, integrations)
2. **Real-Time**: Subscribe to registry update events
3. **Periodic**: Full sync every 1-6 hours to catch any missed events
4. **Storage**: Store everything in InfluxDB with 90-day retention

**Why This is Best**:
- ‚úÖ Real-time updates (< 1 second latency)
- ‚úÖ Never miss changes (periodic backup sync)
- ‚úÖ Reuses existing WebSocket connection
- ‚úÖ Minimal overhead (< 5%)
- ‚úÖ High reliability (‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê)

**Effort**: 6-8 weeks full implementation  
**Complexity**: Medium  
**Impact**: Comprehensive device/entity inventory with real-time tracking

---

### ü•à #2: WebSocket Commands Only

**What**: Query registries on-demand via WebSocket

**How It Works**:
- Query registries when needed
- No automatic updates
- Poll periodically for changes

**Why Good**:
- ‚úÖ Simple implementation (2-3 weeks)
- ‚úÖ Direct API access
- ‚úÖ Low complexity

**Why Not Best**:
- ‚ùå No automatic updates
- ‚ùå Requires polling
- ‚ùå May miss real-time changes

---

### ü•â #3: REST API + Templates

**What**: Use REST API with Jinja2 templates

**How It Works**:
- HTTP POST to `/api/template` endpoint
- Complex Jinja2 templates to extract data
- Poll for updates

**Why Good**:
- ‚úÖ No WebSocket needed
- ‚úÖ Very simple (1-2 weeks)
- ‚úÖ Easy to test

**Why Not Best**:
- ‚ùå Requires polling (no real-time)
- ‚ùå Complex template syntax
- ‚ùå More HTTP overhead
