### Goals and Background Context

#### Goals
- Transform the health dashboard into a modern, visually appealing monitoring interface
- Provide preset dashboard layouts optimized for different monitoring scenarios
- Implement modern data visualization with interactive charts and better indicators
- Enhance real-time capabilities with improved WebSocket integration and notifications
- Improve mobile experience and accessibility compliance
- Implement data export and historical analysis capabilities
- Create a dashboard that clearly shows system health and status at a glance

#### Background Context
The current health dashboard serves as the primary monitoring interface for the Home Assistant Ingestor system. While functional, it lacks modern visual design and could better communicate system status. Users need a more visually appealing interface that clearly shows system health, modern data visualization, and better real-time monitoring capabilities. The enhancement will transform it into a modern, easy-to-understand monitoring platform while maintaining full backward compatibility with existing integrations and APIs.
