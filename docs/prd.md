# Home Assistant Ingestion Layer Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Establish comprehensive historical data infrastructure for Home Assistant events with 99.9% data capture reliability
- Enable multi-temporal pattern analysis (day/week/month/season/year patterns) through optimized data schema
- Achieve one-command deployment via Docker Compose with <30 minute setup time
- Maintain enriched data with weather and presence context for 95%+ of events
- Handle 10,000+ events per day with sub-second processing latency
- Transform Home Assistant from reactive automation platform into data-driven smart home intelligence system

### Background Context

Home Assistant users currently operate in a reactive mode with limited historical data visibility. While Home Assistant excels at real-time automation and device control, it lacks comprehensive data analysis capabilities. Users cannot easily answer questions like "What are my energy usage patterns?", "When do I typically arrive home?", or "How do weather conditions affect my heating patterns?"

This ingestion layer addresses the critical gap where generic IoT analytics platforms lack Home Assistant-specific integration while enterprise solutions are over-engineered for home use. By capturing all Home Assistant events via WebSocket API, enriching them with external context (weather, presence), and storing everything in InfluxDB with a schema optimized for pattern analysis, we transform Home Assistant into a data-driven smart home intelligence system.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision

The system prioritizes simplicity and reliability over complex interfaces. Users should be able to deploy and manage the ingestion layer with minimal configuration, focusing on data capture rather than complex analytics interfaces. The experience should feel like a "set it and forget it" service that quietly captures and enriches Home Assistant data in the background.

### Key Interaction Paradigms

- **Command-Line First:** Primary interaction through Docker Compose commands and CLI tools for technical users
- **Configuration-Driven:** Simple YAML configuration files for setup rather than complex web interfaces
- **Background Operation:** Minimal user interaction required once deployed - system operates autonomously
- **Status Visibility:** Clear health monitoring and logging for troubleshooting when needed

### Core Screens and Views

- **Docker Compose Setup:** Single command deployment with clear status output
- **Configuration Management:** YAML-based configuration for Home Assistant connection and weather API settings
- **Health Dashboard:** CLI-based status monitoring showing ingestion rates, data quality, and system health
- **Log Viewer:** Structured logging output for troubleshooting and monitoring
- **Data Query Interface:** Future web interface for querying historical data and basic pattern visualization

### Accessibility: None

### Branding

The system should maintain a clean, technical aesthetic that aligns with Home Assistant's open-source, community-driven approach. Focus on functionality over visual design, with clear, readable interfaces that prioritize information density and technical accuracy.

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

The system will primarily run on Linux servers, Windows with WSL2, or macOS with Docker Desktop. Any future web interfaces should be responsive and work across desktop and mobile devices for monitoring and configuration.

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo

Single repository with Docker Compose orchestration containing all services (ingestion, weather API, database) in a unified structure. This simplifies deployment and maintenance for home users while keeping all components tightly integrated.

### Service Architecture: Microservices

Microservices approach with separate containers for WebSocket client, enrichment pipeline, and database. This provides loose coupling, independent scaling, and fault isolation while maintaining simple orchestration through Docker Compose.

### Testing Requirements: Unit + Integration

Comprehensive testing approach including unit tests for individual components, integration tests for service interactions, and end-to-end tests for complete data flow. Focus on testing WebSocket connectivity, data transformation, and database operations with mock Home Assistant instances for reliable CI/CD.

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests

- **Language:** Python with aiohttp for WebSocket client and asyncio for concurrent processing
- **Database:** InfluxDB 2.x for time-series storage with InfluxQL/SQL query support
- **Deployment:** Docker Compose orchestration with local deployment focus
- **Authentication:** Long-lived access tokens for Home Assistant WebSocket API
- **External APIs:** Weather API integration (OpenWeatherMap/WeatherAPI) with rate limiting and fallback handling
- **Monitoring:** Structured logging with health check endpoints for service monitoring
- **Storage:** Local data storage for privacy with optional cloud backup capabilities
- **Network:** WebSocket API for real-time event capture with automatic reconnection
- **Schema:** Optimized InfluxDB schema with proper tagging (entity_id, domain, device_class) for efficient querying
- **Retention:** 1-year data retention policy with automatic cleanup and storage optimization
