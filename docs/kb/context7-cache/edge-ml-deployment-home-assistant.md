**Last Updated:** 2025-10-15  
**Category:** Deployment Architecture  
**Context:** Resource-constrained home automation environments  
**Hardware:** Raspberry Pi, Intel NUC, Home Assistant OS

## Overview

This document outlines deployment strategies for AI/ML workloads in resource-constrained Home Assistant environments, including hardware requirements and optimization strategies.

## Hardware Deployment Tiers

### Tier 1: Lightweight (Raspberry Pi 4/5 - 2-8GB RAM)

**Suitable For:** Basic pattern detection, API-based LLM

**Stack:**
```python
# Minimal Local Processing
- scikit-learn (lightweight models only)
- pandas (data preparation)
- FastAPI (API service)
- OpenAI/Anthropic API (external LLM - no local compute)
- SQLite (pattern cache)

# Avoid on Pi:
❌ Prophet (too heavy)
❌ Deep learning frameworks
❌ Local LLM models
```

**Approach:**
- **Pattern detection runs on schedule** (daily/weekly batch jobs)
- **Simple clustering algorithms** (KMeans with <10k data points)
- **External LLM API** for automation generation (zero local LLM compute)
- **Aggressive caching** to minimize recomputation
- **Async background processing** to avoid blocking HA

**Expected Performance:**
- Pattern analysis: 5-15 minutes for 30 days of data
- API response time: <500ms (cache hits)
- Memory usage: 500MB-1GB
- CPU usage: Spikes to 80% during batch, idle otherwise

**Limitations:**
- No real-time pattern detection
- Limited to 100-200 devices
- Simple clustering only
- Dependent on external API availability

---

### Tier 2: Moderate (Intel NUC i5/i7, 16GB RAM)

**Suitable For:** Full-featured pattern analysis, moderate scale

## Optimization Strategies for Resource-Constrained Environments

### 1. Batch Processing

```python
# Run pattern analysis on schedule, not real-time
schedule:
  - Daily at 3 AM: Full pattern analysis (30 days)
  - Hourly: Quick update (last 1 hour only)
  - On-demand: User-triggered refresh
```

### 2. Incremental Learning

```python
# Don't recompute everything
- Store previous patterns in cache
- Only analyze new data since last run
- Merge new patterns with cached patterns
- Update confidence scores incrementally
```

### 3. Model Pruning

```python
# Use simplified models on edge
- Limit clustering to top 20 most-used devices
- Use mini-batch KMeans for large datasets
- Sample data intelligently (peak hours, not idle time)
- Reduce feature dimensions (PCA if needed)
```

### 4. Aggressive Caching

```python
# Cache everything possible
- Pattern detection results (TTL: 24 hours)
- LLM responses (TTL: 7 days)
- Feature engineering outputs (TTL: 1 hour)
- Device metadata (TTL: indefinite, invalidate on change)
```

### 5. Async Processing

```python
# Never block the main thread
- Use Celery or similar for background jobs
- Queue expensive operations
- Return cached results immediately
- Update cache in background
```

## Memory Footprint Guidelines

### scikit-learn Models

```python
KMeans (100k samples, 10 features): ~50MB
DBSCAN (100k samples): ~80MB  
Isolation Forest: ~30MB
```

### Prophet

```python
Single time series (1 year daily): ~200MB
Multiple series (10 devices): ~2GB
```

**Mitigation:** Run Prophet on subsets, not all devices at once

### LangChain + OpenAI API

```python
LangChain framework: ~100MB
API calls: ~5MB per request/response
Cache: 10MB per 100 cached responses
```

### Total Estimated Memory

**Tier 1 (Pi):** 500MB-1GB  
**Tier 2 (NUC):** 2-4GB  
**Tier 3 (Server):** 8-16GB

## CPU Utilization Patterns

### Pattern Analysis Job

```python
Raspberry Pi 4:
  - 80-100% CPU for 5-15 minutes
  - Fans may be required
  - Schedule during low-usage times

Intel NUC i5:
  - 40-60% CPU for 2-5 minutes
  - No thermal issues

Intel NUC i7:
  - 30-40% CPU for 1-2 minutes
  - Minimal impact on HA
```

### API Service

```python
All Tiers:
  - <5% CPU during idle (cache hits)
  - 10-20% CPU during LLM API calls
  - Spikes to 30-40% during cache misses
```

---

## Storage Requirements

### Minimum Storage

```python
Service code: 100MB
Python dependencies: 500MB
ML models (trained): 200MB
Pattern cache: 100MB
LLM cache (API responses): 50MB
Total: ~1GB
```

### Recommended Storage

```python
Service + dependencies: 1GB
Pattern cache (7 days): 500MB
LLM response cache (30 days): 200MB
Logs: 100MB
Total: ~2GB
```

**Note:** This is IN ADDITION to Home Assistant's storage needs (typically 32-128GB)

---

## Network Requirements

### API-Based Approach (Tier 1)

```python
LLM API calls:
  - Request: 5-20 KB
  - Response: 2-10 KB
  - Frequency: On-demand + daily batch
  - Monthly data: 50-200 MB

Impact: Minimal, works on standard home internet
```

### Local LLM Approach (Tier 3)

```python
Model download (one-time):
  - Llama 3 8B: ~5GB
  - Llama 3 70B: ~40GB

Ongoing: Zero external traffic
```

## Final Recommendation for Your Use Case

**For a single-home Home Assistant installation:**

### Best Option: Tier 1 (Hybrid Cloud-Edge)

**Rationale:**
1. ✅ **Works on existing HA hardware** (Pi 4+ or NUC)
2. ✅ **Low maintenance** (no model training/updates)
3. ✅ **Best LLM quality** (GPT-4o API)
4. ✅ **Fast development** (less complexity)
5. ✅ **Scalable** (upgrade to Tier 2 later if needed)
6. ✅ **Cost-effective** ($10-20/month API costs vs $500+ hardware)

**Trade-off:** Requires internet for LLM, ~$15/month API cost

### Alternative: Tier 2 (Fully Local)

**When to choose:**
- Privacy is paramount (no external APIs)
- Internet unreliable or not desired
- Willing to invest in hardware ($500-800)
- Accept slightly lower LLM quality (local models)

**Document Maintenance:**
- Update quarterly with new hardware benchmarks
- Revise as edge ML frameworks improve
- Add real-world performance metrics from production
