## Summary

Successfully updated the Home Assistant API documentation in our knowledge base cache. The previous cache was 5 days old (Oct 7, 2025) and has been refreshed with the latest documentation from the official Home Assistant Developers repository.

## What Was Updated

### 1. **WebSocket API Documentation** (Major Update)

#### New Content Added:
- âœ… Complete authentication flow with all message types
- âœ… Feature declaration (`supported_features`) for message coalescing
- âœ… Comprehensive event subscription patterns
- âœ… Trigger-based subscriptions (automation-style)
- âœ… Event unsubscription with proper cleanup
- âœ… Fire custom events with context
- âœ… Security patterns with `@require_admin` decorator
- âœ… Custom WebSocket command registration

#### Enhanced Coverage:
- **State Changed Events**: Full event structure with `new_state`, `old_state`, and `context`
- **Event Context**: Complete context chain tracking (`id`, `parent_id`, `user_id`)
- **Trigger Events**: Detailed trigger variable structure
- **Message Format**: All message types with complete examples

### 2. **REST API Documentation** (New Addition)

Previously our cache focused only on entities and events. Now includes:

- âœ… **States API**: GET all states, GET single state, POST to update/create
- âœ… **Services API**: GET services list, POST to call services
- âœ… **Service Response Data**: New `return_response` query parameter support
- âœ… **Intent API**: Handle intents via REST
- âœ… **Complete curl examples** for all endpoints
- âœ… **Python examples** for common operations

#### Critical Distinction Clarified:
- **POST /api/states/<entity_id>**: Updates representation only (does NOT control device)
- **POST /api/services/<domain>/<service>**: Actually controls/interacts with devices
- Added warnings and examples to prevent common mistakes

### 3. **Authentication** (Enhanced)

- âœ… Long-lived access token generation via WebSocket API
- âœ… Long-lived access token generation via UI (step-by-step)
- âœ… Token security best practices
- âœ… Authentication failure handling

### 4. **Entity Management** (Expanded)

- âœ… Complete entity lifecycle documentation
- âœ… Common entity types with descriptions
- âœ… Entity state structure with all fields explained
- âœ… Entity availability and category management

### 5. **Event System** (Comprehensive)

- âœ… Complete list of built-in event types
- âœ… Event patterns (event-driven architecture, filtering, context tracking)
- âœ… Event timing and origin tracking
- âœ… Custom event creation

### 6. **Integration Development** (New Section)

- âœ… Service registration Python code examples
- âœ… Integration patterns (polling, push, hybrid, async, batch, streaming)
- âœ… WebSocket command registration
- âœ… Security decorators and permission checking

### 7. **Best Practices** (New Section)

Created comprehensive best practices for:
- **WebSocket API**: Connection handling, subscriptions, error recovery
- **REST API**: Token usage, caching, rate limiting
- **Performance**: Event filtering, batching, async operations
- **Error Handling**: Auth failures, reconnection logic, circuit breakers

### 8. **HA-Ingestor Specific Patterns** (New Section)

Added project-specific integration patterns:
- âœ… Complete WebSocket connection pattern with async/await
- âœ… Event processing pattern for state changes
- âœ… Error handling specific to our use case
- âœ… Integration with InfluxDB storage
