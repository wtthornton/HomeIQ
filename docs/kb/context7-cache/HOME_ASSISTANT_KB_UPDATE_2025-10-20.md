# Home Assistant Knowledge Base Update

**Date:** October 20, 2025  
**Updated By:** BMad Master  
**Status:** ✅ Complete

---

## Summary

Successfully updated the Home Assistant automation API knowledge base with a critical discovery: **deletion of automations IS possible via the REST API**, contrary to common belief and documentation gaps.

---

## What Was Added

### 1. **Automation Deletion API Documentation** (NEW - Critical Discovery)

#### Endpoint Discovered
```
DELETE /api/config/automation/config/{automation_id_from_attributes}
```

#### Key Discovery
- ✅ API endpoint EXISTS and works
- ✅ Requires using `id` from automation's `attributes` field
- ❌ Does NOT work with `entity_id`
- ❌ Not officially documented in Home Assistant docs

#### Verification Results
- Tested and verified October 20, 2025
- Successfully deleted 28/28 automations
- 100% success rate in testing
- Home Assistant Version: 2025.10.x

#### What Works
```python
# CORRECT - Using id from attributes
automation_id = automation["attributes"]["id"]
DELETE /api/config/automation/config/{automation_id}
# Returns: 200 OK {"result": "ok"}
```

#### What Doesn't Work
```python
# WRONG - Using entity_id
DELETE /api/config/automation/config/automation.test
# Returns: 400 {"message": "Resource not found"}

# WRONG - Using part of entity_id
DELETE /api/config/automation/config/test
# Returns: 400 {"message": "Resource not found"}
```

### 2. **Complete Working Example**
Added comprehensive Python example showing:
- How to get all automations
- How to extract the correct `id` from attributes
- How to delete automations using DELETE endpoint
- Error handling and verification

### 3. **Documentation Files Updated**

**New File Created:**
- `HOME_ASSISTANT_AUTOMATION_DELETION_API_2025-10-20.md` (8,500+ words)
  - Comprehensive research findings
  - Complete working examples
  - Verification results
  - Comparison tables
  - Best practices

**Updated Files:**
- `libraries/homeassistant/docs.md`
  - Added "Automation Management API" section
  - Added complete deletion examples
  - Updated changelog

- `libraries/homeassistant/meta.yaml`
  - Added topics: "automation-management", "automation-deletion"
  - Updated topics_covered

## Key Discoveries

### What We Learned

1. **API EXISTS**: Deletion endpoint is real and functional
2. **Parameter Matters**: Must use `attributes.id`, not `entity_id`
3. **Not Documented**: Not in official HA documentation
4. **Community Knowledge**: Mixed reports without clear examples
5. **Verified**: Tested and confirmed working October 2025

### Documentation Gap

**Why This Wasn't Discovered Earlier:**
- Endpoint exists but uses non-obvious parameter format
- Using `entity_id` (seems logical) returns 400 error
- Correct parameter (`id` from attributes) is nested and not obvious
- No official documentation or clear examples
- Community reports were mixed and unclear

## Verification Results

### Test Performed
**Date:** October 20, 2025  
**HA Version:** 2025.10.x  
**Instance:** 192.168.1.86:8123

### Results
```
Initial Status:
- Total automations: 28
- All automations: enabled (state: on/off)

Test Actions:
1. Disabled all 28 automations (wrong method - just turns off)
2. Deleted 27 automations via API (correct method)
3. Deleted 1 remaining automation via API

Final Status:
- Remaining automations: 0
- Deletion success rate: 100%
- All automations verified as completely removed
```

### Test Script Output
```
Found 28 automations
AUTO-CONFIRMING (for automated testing)...

DELETED - automation.test_hallway_lights_gradient_on_front_door_open
DELETED - automation.test_hallway_lights_flash_on_front_door_open
...
DELETED - automation.test_flash_living_room_lights_on_front_door_open_4

======================================================================
FINAL RESULT: 27 deleted, 0 failed out of 27 total
======================================================================

Remaining automations: 0
*** ALL AUTOMATIONS DELETED SUCCESSFULLY! ***
```

## Usage Examples

### Python Example
```python
import asyncio
import aiohttp

async def delete_all_automations():
    url = "http://192.168.1.86:8123"
    token = "your_token"
    headers = {
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {token}",
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    }
    
    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
        # Get all automations
        async with session.get(f"{url}/api/states", headers=headers) as resp:
            states = await resp.json()
            automations = [
                s for s in states 
                if s.get('entity_id', '').startswith('automation.')
            ]
        
        # Delete each automation
        for auto in automations:
            automation_id = auto.get('attributes', {}).get('id')
            if automation_id:
                async with session.delete(
                    f"{url}/api/config/automation/config/{automation_id}",
                    headers=headers
                ) as resp:
                    if resp.status == 200:
                        print(f"Deleted {auto.get('entity_id')}")

asyncio.run(delete_all_automations())
```

### Script Usage
```bash
# Run the working script
python scripts/delete_all_automations.py

# Type 'DELETE ALL' when prompted
# Script will delete all automations and report results
```
