# AI/ML Recommendation Systems Best Practices

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-15  
**Category:** AI/ML Architecture  
**Technologies:** Python, scikit-learn, PyTorch, LangChain, OpenAI API  
**Use Case:** Pattern recognition, recommendation engines, automation suggestion systems

## Overview

This document outlines best practices for building AI-powered recommendation and pattern recognition systems, specifically for IoT and home automation contexts.

## Architecture Patterns

### 1. Hybrid Recommendation Systems

**Best Practice:** Combine multiple recommendation approaches for robust suggestions:

- **Content-Based Filtering:** Analyze device attributes, usage patterns, and temporal features
- **Collaborative Filtering:** Learn from similar user patterns (if multi-user data available)
- **Rule-Based Logic:** Apply domain-specific automation rules and constraints
- **LLM-Based Generation:** Use large language models for natural language automation suggestions

**Rationale:** No single approach handles all scenarios. Hybrid systems provide better coverage and accuracy.

### 2. Pattern Recognition Architecture

**Recommended Stack:**

```python
# Time-Series Pattern Analysis
- Prophet (Facebook) - Time series forecasting with seasonal patterns
- statsmodels - Statistical pattern analysis and ARIMA models
- pandas - Data manipulation and windowing

# Machine Learning
- scikit-learn - Classical ML algorithms (clustering, classification)
  - KMeans, DBSCAN for usage pattern clustering
  - Random Forest for feature importance
  - Isolation Forest for anomaly detection
  
# Deep Learning (if needed)
- PyTorch or TensorFlow - Neural networks for complex patterns
- LSTM/GRU - Sequence modeling for temporal patterns

# LLM Integration
- LangChain - LLM orchestration and prompt management
- OpenAI API (GPT-4) - Natural language generation for suggestions
- Anthropic Claude - Alternative LLM with strong reasoning
```

**Rationale:** Start with classical ML (scikit-learn), add time-series analysis (Prophet), only use deep learning if patterns are too complex for simpler approaches.

## Data Pipeline Best Practices

### 1. Feature Engineering

**Critical Features for Home Automation:**

```python
# Temporal Features
- Hour of day, day of week, month
- Time since last state change
- Duration in current state
- Frequency of state changes

# Device Interaction Features
- Co-occurrence patterns (devices used together)
- Sequential patterns (device A then device B)
- State correlations (device states that align)

# Contextual Features  
- Weather conditions
- Occupancy status
- Time of day categories (morning, evening, night)
- Special events (sports games, calendar events)
```

**Best Practice:** Create rolling window aggregations (hourly, daily, weekly) to capture patterns at multiple time scales.

### 2. Data Preparation

```python
# InfluxDB Query Strategy
- Use downsample() for efficient aggregation
- Apply window functions for rolling statistics
- Leverage tags for efficient filtering
- Batch queries to reduce API calls

# Feature Scaling
- StandardScaler for most ML algorithms
- MinMaxScaler for neural networks
- RobustScaler for data with outliers
```

## Pattern Detection Strategies

### 1. Temporal Pattern Mining

**Best Practices:**

```python
# Daily Routines
- Cluster device usage by hour of day
- Identify repeated sequences (morning routine, bedtime)
- Detect anomalies (unusual patterns that might need automation)

# Seasonal Patterns
- Weekly patterns (weekday vs weekend)
- Monthly patterns (seasonal changes)
- Event-driven patterns (sports games, holidays)
```

**Tools:**
- `Prophet` for automatic seasonality detection
- `scikit-learn KMeans` for usage clustering
- `scipy.signal.find_peaks` for pattern peak detection

### 2. Anomaly Detection

**Identify automation opportunities:**

```python
# Isolation Forest (scikit-learn)
- Detects unusual device usage patterns
- Identifies manual interventions that could be automated

# Statistical Approaches
- Z-score analysis for outlier detection
- Moving average deviation for trend changes
```

**Best Practice:** Anomalies often reveal unmet automation needs (e.g., user manually adjusting thermostat at same time daily = automation opportunity).

## LLM Integration Patterns

### 1. Prompt Engineering for Automation Suggestions

**Best Practice Structure:**

```python
SYSTEM_PROMPT = """
You are an expert home automation advisor. Generate practical, 
safe automation suggestions based on observed patterns.

Context:
- Device capabilities: {devices}
- Observed patterns: {patterns}
- Existing automations: {current_automations}

Requirements:
- Suggestions must be achievable with available devices
- Include clear triggers, conditions, and actions
- Explain the rationale based on observed patterns
- Prioritize safety and user preferences
"""

USER_PROMPT = """
Pattern detected: {pattern_description}
Devices involved: {device_list}
Frequency: {frequency}
Confidence: {confidence_score}

Generate 3 automation suggestions that leverage this pattern.
Format as JSON with: trigger, conditions, actions, rationale, priority
"""
```

### 2. Structured Output Generation

**Use JSON Schema for consistent automation format:**

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel

class AutomationSuggestion(BaseModel):
    title: str
    category: str  # energy, comfort, security, convenience
    trigger: dict  # type, entity_id, conditions
    actions: list[dict]  # service calls
    rationale: str  # why this is suggested
    confidence: float  # 0.0 - 1.0
    impact: str  # estimated energy/time savings
```

**Best Practice:** Use OpenAI's structured output mode or Pydantic for reliable parsing.

### 3. LLM Provider Selection

**Recommendations:**

```python
# For Automation Generation
- OpenAI GPT-4o: Best reasoning, structured output support
- Anthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet: Strong reasoning, good for complex logic

# For Pattern Explanation
- OpenAI GPT-4o-mini: Cost-effective for descriptions
- Local models (Ollama): Privacy-focused, no API costs

# Best Practice: Use smaller models for descriptions,
# larger models for complex automation logic generation
```

## Implementation Architecture

### 1. Microservice Design

**Recommended Structure:**

```
ai-automation-service/
├── src/
│   ├── pattern_analyzer.py      # Pattern detection engine
│   ├── recommendation_engine.py # Suggestion generation
│   ├── llm_orchestrator.py      # LLM integration layer
│   ├── feature_engineering.py   # Feature extraction
│   ├── models/                  # ML model storage
│   └── cache/                   # Pattern cache
├── requirements.txt
└── Dockerfile
```

**Best Practices:**

- **Separation of Concerns:** Pattern detection separate from LLM generation
- **Caching:** Cache patterns and embeddings to reduce computation
- **Async Processing:** Use background jobs for expensive ML operations
- **Model Versioning:** Track model versions for reproducibility

## Performance Optimization

### 1. Computation Strategy

**Best Practices:**

```python
# Batch Processing
- Run pattern analysis on schedule (daily/weekly)
- Cache results for fast API responses
- Incremental updates for new data

# Progressive Analysis
- Quick patterns (last 24h) - real-time
- Medium patterns (last 7d) - hourly refresh  
- Long patterns (last 30d) - daily refresh
```

### 2. Model Serving

```python
# Production Recommendations
- Serve models via FastAPI endpoints
- Use joblib for sklearn model persistence
- Implement model warm-up on service start
- Monitor inference latency (<100ms target)
```

## Categorization Framework

### Automation Categories

**Best Practice:** Organize suggestions by user value:

```python
CATEGORIES = {
    "energy_savings": {
        "priority": "high",
        "examples": ["Lights off when away", "Thermostat optimization"]
    },
    "comfort": {
        "priority": "medium", 
        "examples": ["Auto-adjust temperature", "Welcome home scene"]
    },
    "security": {
        "priority": "high",
        "examples": ["Lock when leaving", "Alert on unusual activity"]
    },
    "convenience": {
        "priority": "medium",
        "examples": ["Morning routine", "Bedtime automation"]
    },
    "health": {
        "priority": "medium",
        "examples": ["Air quality alerts", "Activity reminders"]
    }
}
```

## Safety and Ethics

### 1. Safety Constraints

**Critical Requirements:**

```python
# Automation Safety Rules
- Never suggest automations that could cause harm
- Require user approval for all security-related automations
- Implement timeout/override mechanisms
- Log all automation executions for audit

# Device Safety
- Verify device capabilities before suggesting actions
- Respect device constraints (e.g., max temp for thermostats)
- Include failsafes (e.g., "unless someone is home")
```

### 2. Privacy Considerations

```python
# Data Privacy
- All pattern analysis runs locally
- No raw device data sent to external LLM APIs
- Send only anonymized patterns to LLM
- Allow user to opt out of specific analysis types
```

## Testing Strategy

### 1. Pattern Detection Testing

```python
# Unit Tests
- Test feature engineering with known patterns
- Validate clustering results with synthetic data
- Verify anomaly detection accuracy

# Integration Tests
- Test full pipeline with historical data
- Validate pattern cache updates
- Test API response times
```

### 2. LLM Output Validation

```python
# Automation Suggestion Validation
- Parse JSON structure (Pydantic validation)
- Verify device IDs exist in HA
- Check trigger/action syntax
- Validate against HA automation schema
```

## Monitoring and Observability

### 1. ML Pipeline Metrics

```python
# Track These Metrics
- Pattern detection latency
- Number of patterns detected per run
- LLM API call costs and latency  
- Suggestion acceptance rate (user feedback)
- False positive rate (bad suggestions)
```

### 2. Model Performance

```python
# Continuous Monitoring
- Pattern confidence scores
- LLM token usage and costs
- Cache hit rates
- API error rates
```

## Scaling Considerations

### Future Enhancements

```python
# When to Scale Up
- More than 100 devices → Consider distributed processing
- Complex patterns → Add deep learning (LSTM/Transformers)
- Multi-user → Add federated learning for privacy
- Real-time suggestions → Add streaming pattern detection

# Cost Optimization
- Use local LLMs (Ollama) for development/testing
- Cache LLM responses aggressively
- Implement rate limiting for expensive operations
```
