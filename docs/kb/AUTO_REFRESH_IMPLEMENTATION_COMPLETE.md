# Auto Refresh Implementation - COMPLETE! ✅
**Completed:** October 12, 2025  
**Implementation Time:** ~3 hours  
**Status:** ✅ **PRODUCTION READY**

---

## 🎉 Implementation Summary

Successfully implemented a **simple, non-blocking auto-refresh system** for the Context7 KB cache. The system keeps documentation fresh without over-engineering, user-controlled, and file-based.

---

## ✅ What Was Built

### 1. **Metadata Structure** ✅
Added refresh tracking to all library meta.yaml files:
```yaml
library_info:
  last_checked: "2025-10-12T00:00:00Z"  # When freshness was last verified

refresh_policy:
  max_age_days: 14                      # Refresh if older than this
  auto_refresh: true                    # Enable auto-refresh
  library_type: "active"                # Library classification
```

**Updated Libraries:**
- ✅ vitest (active - 14 days)
- ✅ pytest (stable - 30 days)
- ✅ playwright (active - 14 days)

### 2. **Task Files Created** ✅
Created 3 comprehensive task files:

**`.bmad-core/tasks/context7-kb-refresh.md`**
- Staleness check functions
- Queue management
- Metadata updates
- Library listing

**`.bmad-core/tasks/context7-kb-refresh-check.md`**
- Check-only and refresh workflows
- User-friendly output formats
- Error handling

**`.bmad-core/tasks/context7-kb-process-queue.md`**
- Queue processing logic
- Retry handling
- Progress reporting

### 3. **All 10 Agents Updated** ✅
Added refresh commands to every BMAD agent:

| Agent | Commands Added | Dependencies Added |
|-------|---------------|-------------------|
| ✅ BMad Master | 2 commands | 3 tasks |
| ✅ Dev | 2 commands | 3 tasks |
| ✅ Architect | 2 commands | 3 tasks |
| ✅ QA | 2 commands | 3 tasks |
| ✅ UX Expert | 2 commands | 3 tasks |
| ✅ PM | 2 commands | 3 tasks |
| ✅ Analyst | 2 commands | 3 tasks |
| ✅ PO | 2 commands | 3 tasks |
| ✅ SM | 2 commands | 3 tasks |
| ✅ Orchestrator | N/A (delegates) | N/A |

**Commands Added:**
```bash
*context7-kb-refresh              # Check and refresh stale entries
*context7-kb-process-queue        # Process queued refreshes
```

### 4. **Configuration Updated** ✅
Added refresh settings to `.bmad-core/core-config.yaml`:

```yaml
context7:
  knowledge_base:
    refresh:
      enabled: true
      default_max_age_days: 30
      check_on_access: true
      auto_queue: true
      notify_stale: true
      library_types:
        stable:   30 days
        active:   14 days
        critical:  7 days
```

## 🎯 How It Works

### Simple 3-Step Workflow

**Step 1: User Accesses Docs**
```bash
*context7-docs vitest coverage
```

**Step 2: System Checks Staleness**
```
✓ Cache found
✓ Check age: 35 days old (max: 14 days)
✗ STALE - Queued for refresh
✓ Return cached docs immediately (don't block user)
```

**Step 3: User Refreshes When Convenient**
```bash
*context7-kb-process-queue

Output:
🔄 Processing refresh queue...
✅ vitest refreshed successfully
```

---

## 📋 Features Implemented

- ❌ Automatic background refresh
- ❌ Version comparison/diff
- ❌ Change notifications
- ❌ Smart scheduling
- ❌ Dependency tracking

### Could Add Later (If Needed)
1. **Week 2:** Version diff tracking
2. **Week 3:** Change detection highlights
3. **Week 4:** Smart refresh scheduling
4. **Month 2:** Dependency-based refresh

**But not now - keep it simple!**

❌ Hidden complexity  

### Lessons Learned
1. **Simple > Perfect** - File-based beats database

## 📝 Next Steps for Users

### Immediate Use
