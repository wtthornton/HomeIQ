# WebSocket Event Processing Debug Analysis

## Issue Summary
**Problem**: Event Processing showing 0.0 events/min in health dashboard despite Home Assistant generating events.

**Root Cause**: WebSocket service connects to Home Assistant but fails to subscribe to events or process them through the event pipeline.

## Investigation Results

### ✅ Confirmed Working Components
1. **Home Assistant Connection**: WebSocket service successfully connects to Home Assistant
2. **Event Generation**: Home Assistant is generating `state_changed` events (confirmed by local test)
3. **Authentication**: WebSocket authentication is working (confirmed by manual test)
4. **Event Processing Pipeline**: Code structure is correct for event processing

### ❌ Identified Issues
1. **No Event Subscription**: WebSocket service is not subscribing to `state_changed` events
2. **No Event Processing Logs**: No logs showing event processing in WebSocket service
3. **Missing Subscription Messages**: No "Successfully subscribed to state_changed events" logs

## Technical Analysis

### Event Processing Flow (Expected)
```
Home Assistant → WebSocket Connection → Event Subscription → Event Processing → Enrichment Pipeline
```

### Current State
```
Home Assistant → WebSocket Connection → [BROKEN] → No Events Processed
```

### Code Analysis
- **Connection Manager**: `_subscribe_to_events()` method exists but not being called
- **Event Handler**: `_on_event()` method exists and should process events
- **Batch Processor**: `_process_batch()` method should send events to enrichment pipeline
- **HTTP Client**: Should forward events to enrichment service

## Context7 KB Research Applied

### WebSocket Debugging Best Practices
Based on Context7 KB documentation for `/websocket-client/websocket-client`:

1. **Enable WebSocket Tracing**: Use `websocket.enableTrace(True)` for debugging
2. **Check Connection Status**: Verify authentication and subscription success
3. **Monitor Event Handlers**: Ensure callbacks are properly registered
4. **Debug Message Flow**: Trace message processing through the pipeline

### Debugging Techniques Applied
1. **Manual WebSocket Test**: Confirmed events are available from Home Assistant
2. **Log Analysis**: Identified missing subscription and processing logs
3. **Service Health Check**: Confirmed all services are running and healthy
4. **Event Flow Tracing**: Mapped expected vs actual event processing flow

## Next Steps Required

### Immediate Actions
1. **Enable WebSocket Tracing**: Add debug logging to WebSocket connection
2. **Fix Event Subscription**: Ensure `_subscribe_to_events()` is called after authentication
3. **Add Debug Logging**: Add more detailed logging to event processing pipeline
4. **Test Event Flow**: Verify events flow from WebSocket to enrichment pipeline

### Long-term Improvements
1. **Add Health Checks**: Implement event processing health monitoring
2. **Add Metrics**: Track event processing rates and success/failure rates
3. **Add Alerts**: Alert when event processing stops or fails
4. **Add Retry Logic**: Implement retry logic for failed event processing
