## Summary by Category


**Total Models Found:** 0
**Total Datasets Found:** 0


## Recommendations

### High Priority for Integration

1. **Time Series Models** - Use for temporal pattern detection
2. **Smart Home Datasets** - Use for fine-tuning if available
3. **Energy Models** - Use for duration/anomaly detection

### Evaluation Criteria

- Model accuracy benchmarks (need >75%)
- Inference speed (<500ms)
- Model size (<2GB for local deployment)
- Active maintenance (updated in last 6 months)
- Good documentation and examples

### Next Steps

1. Review top 5 results in each category
2. Read model cards for accuracy and use cases
3. Test promising models on sample HA data
4. Benchmark against rule-based approach (85-90% baseline)
5. Integrate only if specialized model beats rules by 10%+
